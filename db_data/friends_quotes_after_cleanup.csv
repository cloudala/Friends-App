Monica,3.0,The Thumb,"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'.",1.0
Joey,3.0,The Thumb,"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'it is you'.",1.0
Chandler,3.0,The Thumb,Or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.,1.0
Phoebe,3.0,The Thumb,"Or, or, y'know, um, 'i think we should see other people' means 'ha, ha, I already am'.",1.0

Chandler,3.0,The Thumb,"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. My.. God.",1.0

Joey,9.0,Underdog Gets Away,The bigger half.,1.0
Chandler,9.0,Underdog Gets Away,"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.",1.0

Monica,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.",2.0
Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Yeah, right. Sure!",2.0
Monica,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Really, rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!",2.0
Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.",2.0
Monica,2.0,The Breast Milk,That is not true!,2.0
Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?",2.0

Ross,2.0,The Breast Milk,"No, no, carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",2.0
Chandler,2.0,The Breast Milk,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,2.0

Joey,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to hombre.",2.0
Chandler,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.",2.0
Joey,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",2.0
Chandler,2.0,The Breast Milk,What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,2.0
Joey,2.0,The Breast Milk,"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.",2.0

Monica,2.0,The Breast Milk,"I feel terrible, I really do.",2.0
Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?",2.0
Monica,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?",2.0
Monica,2.0,The Breast Milk,It's that terrible?,2.0
Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.",2.0
Monica,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...we're, we're...oh, I love you.",2.0

Phoebe,2.0,The Breast Milk,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.",2.0
Monica,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",2.0
Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"I'd do anything for you, you know that.",2.0

Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",2.0
Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Well, you're not totally paranoid.",2.0
Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",2.0
Rachel,2.0,The Breast Milk,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",2.0

Chandler,3.0,Heckles Dies,"I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.",2.0
Monica,3.0,Heckles Dies,How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?,2.0
Joey,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Hold it hold it. I gotta side with chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest adam's apple. It made me nuts.",2.0
Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,"I got it. Uh, joey, women don't have adam's apples.",2.0
Joey,3.0,Heckles Dies,"You guys are messin' with me, right?",2.0
Joey,3.0,Heckles Dies,"That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa.""",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.,2.0
Chandler,3.0,Heckles Dies,Maureen rosilla.,2.0
Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,Not hating yanni is not a real reason.,2.0
Monica,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Hello, mr. Heckles.",2.0
Monica,3.0,Heckles Dies,We're not doing anything.,2.0

Monica,3.0,Heckles Dies,That's terrible.,2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, mr. Heckles!",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Like crop circles, or the bermuda triangle, or evolution?",2.0
Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,Nah. Not really.,2.0

Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,"I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",2.0
Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Too easy? Too...the process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Yeah, I just don't buy it.",2.0
Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Ok, don't get me started on gravity.",2.0
Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...i don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.",2.0

Monica,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Well, what about his family?",2.0
Rachel,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Ok, so let's talk money.",2.0
Monica,3.0,Heckles Dies,"I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!",2.0
Rachel,3.0,Heckles Dies,Have you ever seen so much crap?,2.0

Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Well, there you go.",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?",2.0
Chandler,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Hey, look at this. ""my big book of grievances.""",2.0
Joey,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey chandler, look, you're in here too.",2.0

Rachel,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Monica, monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.",2.0
Monica,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.",2.0
Rachel,3.0,Heckles Dies,"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.",2.0
Monica,3.0,Heckles Dies,It doesn't go with any of my stuff.,2.0
Rachel,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Well, what about my stuff?",2.0
Monica,3.0,Heckles Dies,You don't have any stuff.,2.0
Rachel,3.0,Heckles Dies,"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?",2.0

Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Ok, pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",2.0

Chandler,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Wow, heckles was voted class clown, and so was i. He was right. Would you listen to that?",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,I'd call that excessive.,2.0
Chandler,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.",2.0
Joey,3.0,Heckles Dies,"So, you were both dorks. Big deal.",2.0

Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,"It's the only possibility, phoebe.",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,"Ok, ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",2.0
Ross,3.0,Heckles Dies,"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.",2.0
Phoebe,3.0,Heckles Dies,I can't believe you caved.,2.0

Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,Would it matter?,2.0
Monica,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Oh, you are so great! Thank you!",2.0
Joey,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,Are you really not going?,2.0

Monica,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",2.0
Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,If you wanna call that a reason.,2.0
Chandler,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.",2.0
Monica,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Ross, I thought you were over this.",2.0

Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"I'm sorry, what?",2.0
Joey,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",2.0
Joey,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"There's my scene, there's my scene. ""mrs. Wallace, I'm dr. Drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.",2.0

Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,That's great!,2.0
Chandler,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.,2.0
Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,That is so good! Do it again!,2.0

Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, mrs. Adelman.",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" little did she know god was thinking, ""ok, but that's it."" oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,What do you mean?,2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,I think it went into me.,2.0
Monica,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",2.0
Chandler,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the ducks.",2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Ok, who ordered what?",2.0
Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.",2.0
Chandler,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",2.0
Joey,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.,2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,Talk about crap. Try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time.,2.0
Joey,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Uh, pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!",2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,Pretty much.,2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"This is joey, and phoebe, and this is chandler, and you remember ross.",2.0
Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Hi, mrs. Green.",2.0
Chandler,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Believe me, sometimes that happens.",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn dermer. 'course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like soupy sales.",2.0
Joey,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Pheebs, who's evelyn dermer?",2.0

Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.",2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"I know. And mom, I realize you and daddy were upset when I didn't marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?",2.0

Monica,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.,2.0
Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,And you had no idea they weren't getting along?,2.0
Joey,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,They didn't fight a lot?,2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"In my day, divorce was not an option.",2.0
Joey,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Hey, look who's up.",2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",2.0
Monica,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",2.0
Chandler,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.",2.0
Chandler,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.,2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Yes, hi, mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Um, do you wanna sit?",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.",2.0
Phoebe,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.",2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,These are from halloween three years ago.,2.0

Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?",2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,You want me to talk you out of it?,2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,Then what? What do you want?,2.0
Rachel,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,Why on earth would I understand this?,2.0

Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?",2.0
Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,It's ok. I'm sorry.,2.0
Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think susan's right.",2.0
Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",2.0
Ross,11.0,The Lesbian Wedding,"Well then that's it. And if george and adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.",2.0

Joey,7.0,The Race Car Bed,"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",3.0

Joey,16.0,The Morning After,"Yeah, i-i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.",3.0

Chandler,3.0,The Cuffs,"I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",4.0

Monica,3.0,The Cuffs,"Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on.",4.0
Phoebe,3.0,The Cuffs,"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a monica.",4.0
Phoebe,3.0,The Cuffs,"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight a's, his parents would say, ""yeah, he pulled a monica."" y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""yeah I know, he pulled a monica."" or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""yeah, that one's outta here."" though some things don't change.",4.0
Monica,3.0,The Cuffs,"All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.",4.0

Chandler,3.0,The Cuffs,How do monica and phoebe know?,4.0

Monica,5.0,The Kips,"Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.",5.0
Chandler,5.0,The Kips,"Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.",5.0
Monica,5.0,The Kips,"Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.",5.0
Chandler,5.0,The Kips,"Okay, fine, $300.",5.0

Joey,5.0,The Kips,What are you guys woofing about?,5.0

Joey,5.0,The Kips,"Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!",5.0
Ross,5.0,The Kips,You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.,5.0
Joey,5.0,The Kips,You want my advice?,5.0

Joey,5.0,The Kips,"Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.",5.0
Monica,5.0,The Kips,Maybe I could do it.,5.0
Rachel,5.0,The Kips,"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?",5.0
Joey,5.0,The Kips,"I-i-i don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, ross is right back there.",5.0
Rachel,5.0,The Kips,That's not ross!,5.0
Phoebe,5.0,The Kips,Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.,5.0

Joey,5.0,The Kips,"Oh, that poor bastard.",5.0
Rachel,5.0,The Kips,"See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!",5.0
Monica,5.0,The Kips,You're not gonna be phased out!,5.0
Rachel,5.0,The Kips,"Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go.",5.0
Rachel,5.0,The Kips,"Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.",5.0
Joey,5.0,The Kips,"Hey, mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.",5.0

Chandler,5.0,The Kips,Yes that would have made more sense.,5.0
Joey,5.0,The Kips,"Y'know, i-i don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!",5.0

Phoebe,5.0,The Kips,"Oh, sure! Bye ross! Forever.",5.0
Rachel,5.0,The Kips,Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?,5.0
Ross,5.0,The Kips,"I talked to monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.",5.0
Ross,5.0,The Kips,"No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see joey at burger king. So is, is that better?",5.0
Rachel,5.0,The Kips,"No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.",5.0

Chandler,5.0,The Kips,"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",5.0
Monica,5.0,The Kips,"Why, exactly?",5.0
Chandler,5.0,The Kips,"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",5.0
Monica,5.0,The Kips,Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than- ohhh!,5.0
Chandler,5.0,The Kips,"So, this isn't over?",5.0

Chandler,5.0,The Kips,It happened in london.,5.0
Joey,5.0,The Kips,In london!!!,5.0
Chandler,5.0,The Kips,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,5.0
Joey,5.0,The Kips,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!,5.0
Chandler,5.0,The Kips,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!,5.0
Monica,5.0,The Kips,"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",5.0
Joey,5.0,The Kips,"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but",5.0

Monica,5.0,The Kips,"Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.",5.0
Phoebe,5.0,The Kips,Count for what?,5.0
Monica,5.0,The Kips,Count in our heads as-as good madlibs.,5.0
Joey,5.0,The Kips,I guess I'm done.,5.0
Monica,5.0,The Kips,"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!",5.0
Joey,5.0,The Kips,I think I'm gonna take-off.,5.0
Monica,5.0,The Kips,"Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?,5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,I can hear that!,5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,Rachel's at work.,5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,I can still hear you!,5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,"Hey, what's that?",5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,"Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.",5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,Eeeee--ohh!! God!,5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?",5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,"Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!",5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,"Yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!",5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,How come? Everybody else does.,5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,What is that?,5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,"Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.",5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,This is all of your things.,5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,"Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's- emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.",5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,"So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-rachel-ever-used sale.",5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.,5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"Hey, ross, you're okay with that?",5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,"Look, if I can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, I'm sure everything will be fine.",5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,After what I did? Can you blame her?,5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,"Oh my god! You got off easy! When my friend silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"What is he doing? What, emily, thinks ross's furniture has got rachel coodies?",5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,Now calm down joey.,5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let ross see rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing rachel, hence ross stops seeing us!",5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,"Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.",5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,"Yeah I know, we're losing ross, joey said hence",5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"Ohh, whoa god! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?",5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,"Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,I want the little round waffles.,5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,"All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"Okay, y'know what? I'll-i'll have toast!",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,Arghhhh!!!!!!,5.0

Ross,6.0,The Yeti,"Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other.",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!,5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,So you're really okay with this?,5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,"Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-i've been given the gift of time!",5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,"Now that's so funny, because last christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.",5.0

Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.",5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,Wow! That guy is so rude!,5.0

Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"Oh my god! Oh my god, look at these pelts!",5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"What? Uhh, phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,"This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'cause I do.",5.0

Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?",5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,"Well, I mean if uh, if emily gave me a choice",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"It's not right what emily wants you to do! She is totally--owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.",5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,What's going on?,5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,We all hate emily!,5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,"No, ross, we do not hate emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.",5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!,5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,"Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at central perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!",5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.,5.0
Monica,6.0,The Yeti,"God, I feel so guilty about ross.",5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,I kinda feel like it's my fault.,5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!",5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,"Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,"All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.",5.0
Chandler,6.0,The Yeti,"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, i- it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including phil huntley! Remember phil huntley? He was fine!",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,What? Yeti- I mean danny?,5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so. Y'know.",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!,5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know i-i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with capri pants.",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,And stop saying that! I hate that!,5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?,5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,Are you still mad at us?,5.0
Phoebe,6.0,The Yeti,"Oh good! Because we have an ""i'm sorry"" song.",5.0
Ross,6.0,The Yeti,Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.,5.0
Joey,6.0,The Yeti,"Look, ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.",5.0

Monica,6.0,The Yeti,"I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.",5.0
Rachel,6.0,The Yeti,"Yeah, y'know i-i think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.",5.0

Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!,5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Well, I did not know that.",5.0

Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Well, that's what we do. Y'know, i-i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.",5.0
Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.",5.0

Phoebe,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,But somehow you came off as the bad guy.,5.0

Ross,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Ohh, this cake is really good!",5.0
Phoebe,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!",5.0
Phoebe,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""who hear likes ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags! I-i'll be honest with you guys, when I first met ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.",5.0
Phoebe,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",5.0
Ross,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.",5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,Where's monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?,5.0

Rachel,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!",5.0
Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Chandler, why are you doing this?",5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.,5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,I'm doing this because I'm sorry?,5.0
Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?",5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?",5.0
Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.",5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",5.0
Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!,5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.",5.0
Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,Who? Two divorces and joey?!,5.0
Joey,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,She's right y'know.,5.0
Ross,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!",5.0
Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,I didn't think I was!,5.0
Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Oh my god, what would have done if I said yes?",5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door.",5.0
Joey,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Hey ross, will you pass me that knife?",5.0
Ross,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"No, I will not!",5.0
Joey,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",5.0
Ross,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?",5.0
Phoebe,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.",5.0
Rachel,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Oh no wait pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, chandler?",5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Okay, how long is this going to go on.",5.0
Monica,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.",5.0
Ross,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,"This is fun. Hey rach, remember that whole ""we were on a break thing?"" well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?",5.0
Chandler,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,That's not funny.,5.0
Joey,15.0,The Girl Who Hits Joey,That's not funny at all!,5.0
Joey,16.0,The Cop,What are you guys doing up?,5.0
Chandler,16.0,The Cop,"Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?",5.0

Rachel,16.0,The Cop,"Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.",5.0
Phoebe,16.0,The Cop,"Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!",5.0
Joey,16.0,The Cop,"Hey, you guys!",5.0
Joey,16.0,The Cop,"Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?",5.0

Monica,20.0,The Ride Along,"Well thank god you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,What?! We can't do that!,5.0
Monica,20.0,The Ride Along,"We have too! I mean what if ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy emily? The emily that wouldn't let him see you?",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!,5.0
Monica,20.0,The Ride Along,"I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him- help him?",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,I don't think he's the one who needs help.,5.0
Monica,20.0,The Ride Along,"No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.",5.0
Monica,20.0,The Ride Along,"Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!",5.0

Monica,20.0,The Ride Along,There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!,5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,Yeah well unless we tell him.,5.0
Monica,20.0,The Ride Along,"Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Oh, maybe that's emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Hey ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!",5.0
Monica,20.0,The Ride Along,Wow! Play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away!,5.0
Phoebe,20.0,The Ride Along,John glenn is here?!,5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car",5.0

Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!",5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yeah, I didn't know that.",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.,5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,Who jumps at loud noises!,5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,Wow! I could've died tonight.,5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,I do have a newfound respect for life.,5.0
Phoebe,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.",5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,Cut it out ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,Dude! How come you took off?,5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever",5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,Is something wrong?,5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,"No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.",5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,You dove in front of ross! Ross!,5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"That's what this is about! Oh my god, you hate ross!",5.0

Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want ross out of the picture.,5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,What picture?,5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,"Look I'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!",5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose ross over you! No! Iknewyou could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean ross, he need help. He's not street like us!",5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.",5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, i, I wasn't trying to save ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,From a bullet!,5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,I know it doesn't make much sense,5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,Much sense?!,5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"Look chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"I know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!",5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,"So you didn't uh, choose ross before me.",5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.",5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",5.0

Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Okay, just a little scared. What's going on ross?",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!,5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,What?! What? What happened?!,5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with gary, right?",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,And somebody took a shot at me!,5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And rach, ii survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-i want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-i am seeing everything so-so clearly now.",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,Because a car backfired?,5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Okay, why are you here?",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Well, i-i-i don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, emily called you today.",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,You talked to her?,5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Well, okay, what-what did she say?",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because- I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me- not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Right. I guess, I guess I should call emily.",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no ross-ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that?",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Ugh, ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that i-i'm supposed to seize! Y'know?",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but i-i really don't wanna see or talk to her.",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Well, there you go!",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.",5.0
Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,Close call day.,5.0

Rachel,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"Hey pheebs, has gary ever been shot at for real?",5.0
Phoebe,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.",5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,"I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.",5.0
Monica,20.0,The Ride Along,"Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make general way before any of you guys.",5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,Before or after you were shot by your own troops?,5.0
Ross,20.0,The Ride Along,I know where joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.,5.0
Chandler,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",5.0
Joey,20.0,The Ride Along,"Yeah, hero sandwiches.",5.0
Phoebe,20.0,The Ride Along,"Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you joey.",5.0
Phoebe,21.0,The Ball,"I'm fine, thanks.",5.0

Chandler,21.0,The Ball,"So, what are you gonna do?",5.0
Phoebe,21.0,The Ball,I don't know. I'll just handle it- I'll ask you to talk to him!,5.0
Chandler,21.0,The Ball,Me?! Why me?,5.0
Phoebe,21.0,The Ball,"Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him aman!",5.0
Chandler,21.0,The Ball,"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.",5.0
Monica,21.0,The Ball,That is so sweet!,5.0
Chandler,21.0,The Ball,"Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.",5.0

Monica,21.0,The Ball,"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",5.0
Rachel,21.0,The Ball,I tried! They won't take her back.,5.0
Chandler,21.0,The Ball,Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-christ.,5.0
Monica,21.0,The Ball,"Rach, why won't they take it back?",5.0

Phoebe,21.0,The Ball,"I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.",5.0
Monica,21.0,The Ball,"Why, do you write him a lot?",5.0
Phoebe,21.0,The Ball,"No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?",5.0

Phoebe,1.0,Vegas,"Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.",6.0
Monica,1.0,Vegas,"So, what do you think we should do?",6.0
Chandler,1.0,Vegas,I don't know. But i-i-i know I love you!,6.0

Chandler,1.0,Vegas,So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.,6.0
Monica,1.0,Vegas,"That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!",6.0
Chandler,1.0,Vegas,"Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.",6.0
Monica,1.0,Vegas,"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.",6.0

Monica,1.0,Vegas,I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?,6.0
Chandler,1.0,Vegas,"Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?",6.0
Monica,1.0,Vegas,"Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.",6.0
Phoebe,1.0,Vegas,"Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on joey! You can't win if you don't ask any questions!!!",6.0
Phoebe,1.0,Vegas,"Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!",6.0
Joey,1.0,Vegas,All right. All right.,6.0
Phoebe,1.0,Vegas,Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.,6.0

Rachel,1.0,Vegas,"Okay! So, we'll just stay married.",6.0
Ross,1.0,Vegas,"Yes, exactly!",6.0
Rachel,1.0,Vegas,And I will make everyone call me mrs. Geller!,6.0

Rachel,1.0,Vegas,What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!,6.0
Ross,1.0,Vegas,"Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says ms you check the box that says mrs.! It's right next to it!",6.0
Rachel,1.0,Vegas,"Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.",6.0
Ross,1.0,Vegas,I'm asking you to do me a favor.,6.0
Rachel,1.0,Vegas,You are asking me to be your wife!,6.0
Ross,1.0,Vegas,And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.,6.0
Monica,1.0,Vegas,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.,6.0
Chandler,1.0,Vegas,Well you did pull his hair.,6.0

Monica,1.0,Vegas,"This doesn't mean anything, does it?",6.0
Phoebe,1.0,Vegas,"How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape- , a rapist or a killer or something!",6.0
Joey,1.0,Vegas,Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!,6.0

Rachel,1.0,Vegas,"No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, ross, is we can not stay married.",6.0
Ross,1.0,Vegas,I don't know if it's true.,6.0
Rachel,1.0,Vegas,Oh b-b-but it is!,6.0
Ross,1.0,Vegas,"Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...",6.0

Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.",6.0
Chandler,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?,6.0
Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told joey, he cried his eyes out!",6.0

Ross,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",6.0
Ross,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like rachel? I will think about the therapy.",6.0
Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.",6.0
Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",6.0
Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Hey rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!",6.0

Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.",6.0
Rachel,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.",6.0
Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!",6.0
Rachel,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,What is the matter with you?!,6.0
Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!,6.0
Rachel,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.",6.0
Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,What's hard to believe?,6.0
Rachel,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.",6.0
Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",6.0
Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.",6.0

Monica,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,I'm gonna miss you!,6.0
Rachel,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,I mean it's the end of an era!,6.0
Phoebe,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,So? Did you get the annulment?,6.0
Phoebe,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,I knew it! Because you love rachel.,6.0
Ross,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than i,6.0
Phoebe,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.",6.0
Ross,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"I I do, I do not love rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?",6.0
Phoebe,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,I've never been more convinced of your love for her.,6.0
Ross,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,I do not have feelings for rachel! Okay?!,6.0
Ross,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Ohh, what's wrong?!",6.0

Phoebe,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Oh we do, but not just yet.",6.0
Joey,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Really?! Well, when?",6.0
Phoebe,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Okay umm, well, first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.",6.0
Phoebe,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"I know. Then, I'm gonna marry chandler for the money and you'll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids.",6.0
Phoebe,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have chandler's money and rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachel's drinking problem.,6.0
Joey,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"Oh-oh, what about ross?",6.0
Phoebe,2.0,Ross Hugs Rachel,"I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,Dude! What are yo- you trying to kill me?!,6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Uh-huh, what?",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful,6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,How about I move in with you?,6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Well, that would be great but then what do we do about denise?",6.0

Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Yes, denise. Denise!",6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe? Huh? And what about this denise, is she cute?",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! Denise!!!!!,6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Hey rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh, that's true.",6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about naked thursday's right?",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,Hey-hey! I thought naked thursday's was just our thing man!,6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"So, what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,You didn't tell her did you?,6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Of course not, because you're in love with her.",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-i just comforted her, as a friend.",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"What do you mean, comforted her?",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,It's also a sign of friendship.,6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Yeah, not in your case lovey loverson.",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,It was a hug!,6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?,6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on ross, you're a scientist.",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhcoconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!",6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.",6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"I don't know! How about, ""thanks for taking the message."" jeez!",6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Okay listen, y'know when you move in rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Okay so you mean no as in, ""gee chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely.""",6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"So, that's it?",6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,Which is why asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!,6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,Are you mocking me?,6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.",6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Hey, what's up?",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Nothing, monica and I had a stupid fight.",6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"""wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" nice!",6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Pheebs, I have to ask you",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.,6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,You're just staring into space.,6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; ""wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" it's just, there is nothing! The city's full!",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Wait, no, look at this! ""two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, satan worshipers okay"" oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Okay, there's this guy, warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,That sounds great! I'd love to live at warren's!! I love warren! Thank you!,6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's warren's number.",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Okay, you go grab it!",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,I don't know what you're talking about.,6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Look, I do not re-love her.",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,You can live with me.,6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,Oh my god! Are you serious?!,6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,I would love to live with you ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!,6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Well, I'm-i'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Wow! I'm-i'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Ross-ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Hero, I uh, I don't know- well, all right.",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh, I have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has!",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?",6.0
Phoebe,3.0,Ross's Denial,"No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em- now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women",6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,Stop it chandler. I'm sorry too.,6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,Yeah! Oh yes!,6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,We don't have to come up with this now.,6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.",6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,You're-you're-you're gonna bring the barca lounger over here?,6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,Is that a problem?,6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.",6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,See now-now you're taking them away from their home.,6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,In the game room!,6.0
Monica,3.0,Ross's Denial,Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place!!,6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Everything on your application looks really good- ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.,6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.",6.0
Chandler,3.0,Ross's Denial,Why did you take the shower curtain down?,6.0
Joey,3.0,Ross's Denial,That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.,6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at monica's and she and chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?",6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,What?! Over a stupid room!,6.0
Rachel,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!",6.0
Ross,3.0,Ross's Denial,"What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",6.0

Joey,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"The ones that got me the porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?",6.0

Chandler,5.0,Joey's Porsche,All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe krog is not a safe toy.,6.0
Monica,5.0,Joey's Porsche,Good. What made you change your mind?,6.0
Chandler,5.0,Joey's Porsche,I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,6.0
Phoebe,5.0,Joey's Porsche,How did that happen?!!,6.0
Chandler,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.",6.0

Chandler,5.0,Joey's Porsche,But you found the keys to his clothes?,6.0
Joey,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a porsche.",6.0
Monica,5.0,Joey's Porsche,And people will think you own a porsche because you're wearing the clothes?,6.0
Joey,5.0,Joey's Porsche,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?,6.0
Chandler,5.0,Joey's Porsche,That is true.,6.0
Phoebe,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",6.0
Joey,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my porsche.",6.0

Monica,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.",6.0
Phoebe,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",6.0
Chandler,5.0,Joey's Porsche,I think that's gum.,6.0
Phoebe,5.0,Joey's Porsche,I'm pretty sure it's gun.,6.0
Chandler,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.",6.0
Phoebe,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would krog do?",6.0

Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, ""yeah, I do!"" okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'cause let's face it, we're at monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is leslie?

Monica,5.0,Joey's Porsche,But the mess!,6.0
Chandler,5.0,Joey's Porsche,Is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,6.0

Chandler,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",6.0
Rachel,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Oh honey thank god you're home, I was getting worried.",6.0

Ross,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Y'know, i-i- you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?",6.0

Rachel,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.",6.0
Rachel,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",6.0
Rachel,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.",6.0
Ross,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"So then if-if- I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.",6.0
Rachel,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Yeah, don't push it though.",6.0
Ross,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.",6.0
Rachel,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at pizza hut.",6.0
Ross,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"Did i, did I even treat?",6.0
Rachel,5.0,Joey's Porsche,"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",6.0
Ross,5.0,Joey's Porsche,That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.,6.0

Phoebe,6.0,On The Last Night,"Well, how much do you think he needs?",6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.",6.0
Phoebe,6.0,On The Last Night,Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.,6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,Well that would help the pride thing.,6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?,6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,"Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?",6.0

Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,"Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get- no way!",6.0
Monica,6.0,On The Last Night,"Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, ""what were you thinking?""",6.0
Rachel,6.0,On The Last Night,"Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler.",6.0

Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,Wh-how did you lose at cups?!,6.0
Joey,6.0,On The Last Night,"The same way you lost. I started out with a king and a queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a jack and a king, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the cup card, the d-cup, the sittin' down bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!",6.0
Joey,6.0,On The Last Night,"And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in cups.",6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,"All right, let's play one more hand! One more!",6.0
Joey,6.0,On The Last Night,"No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a- I wanna give you something.

Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,I can't take the big white dog! You love it!,6.0
Joey,6.0,On The Last Night,"It's him, not it!",6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,"No, but wait- what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?",6.0
Joey,6.0,On The Last Night,"Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!",6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,When did I try to give you money?,6.0
Joey,6.0,On The Last Night,"Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said ""no,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!",6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.,6.0
Joey,6.0,On The Last Night,"I will be okay! Look chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna missis you. And now the dog.",6.0

Monica,6.0,On The Last Night,What the hell is that dog doing here?!,6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,I invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money.,6.0
Ross,6.0,On The Last Night,And now you want that money back.,6.0
Ross,6.0,On The Last Night,"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?",6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,It's not a real game! I made it up!,6.0
Ross,6.0,On The Last Night,"I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.",6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,At a fake game!!,6.0
Ross,6.0,On The Last Night,"Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at cups.",6.0
Chandler,6.0,On The Last Night,Okay! Now I assume the saucer card came up when you played last.,6.0

Ross,10.0,The Routine,"Wow, monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?",6.0

Phoebe,10.0,The Routine,That is nice and we're done. Tada!,6.0
Chandler,10.0,The Routine,"I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like christmas to me.",6.0
Chandler,10.0,The Routine,See now it feels like christmas!,6.0
Ross,10.0,The Routine,"And that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.",6.0
Rachel,10.0,The Routine,"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",6.0

Joey,10.0,The Routine,"Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a new year's eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'it wasn't me, it was new years!'",6.0
Rachel,10.0,The Routine,"Well, that's a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",6.0
Ross,10.0,The Routine,It was a dry day.,6.0
Monica,10.0,The Routine,We are going to dick clark's new year's rocking eve!,6.0

Monica,12.0,The Joke,Ahhh! You are on my list.,6.0
Chandler,12.0,The Joke,"I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like maintaining you.",6.0
Monica,12.0,The Joke,I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.,6.0

Ross,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!,6.0
Rachel,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",6.0

Ross,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?",6.0
Rachel,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,"Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!",6.0
Ross,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,"Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess i-i just wasn't thinking",6.0

Ross,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,Oh wait- hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.,6.0
Rachel,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.",6.0
Ross,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,Look i-i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us!,6.0
Ross,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,"No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.",6.0
Rachel,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,"Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.",6.0
Ross,14.0,Chandler Can't Cry,You're welcome.,6.0

Joey,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?",6.0
Rachel,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.",6.0
Monica,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II",Why did they get divorced?,6.0
Rachel,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?",6.0
Ross,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.",6.0
Ross,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","The first time! No seriously, imagine if carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.",6.0
Joey,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II",I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.,6.0
Ross,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.",6.0
Chandler,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II",Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.,6.0
Monica,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.",6.0
Chandler,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II",Sure I would!,6.0
Chandler,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?",6.0
Ross,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","No, I just think monica was that fat.",6.0
Joey,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","Hey, imagine if I never got fired off days of our lives! Oh-hey, there's carol again!",6.0
Chandler,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, i-i don't have to wear a tie.",6.0
Phoebe,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II",What if I had taken that job at merrill lynch?,6.0
Rachel,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II",Merrill lynch?,6.0
Phoebe,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II","Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.",6.0
Rachel,15.0,"That Could Have Been, Part I & II",Well why didn't you take the job?,6.0

Rachel,24.0,"The Proposal, Part I & II","So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married.

Rachel,6.0,The Nap Partners,"Look monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.",7.0

Rachel,6.0,The Nap Partners,"Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love.

Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,"You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!",7.0
Joey,6.0,The Nap Partners,"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for rachel- damnit!",7.0

Joey,6.0,The Nap Partners,Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.,7.0
Ross,6.0,The Nap Partners,Why-why would I care about that?,7.0
Joey,6.0,The Nap Partners,"No reason, I'm just saying that uh that's where I'll be.",7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.,7.0
Monica,6.0,The Nap Partners,Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.,7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,I would really love it if could do both.,7.0
Monica,6.0,The Nap Partners,"All right, ii have to ask.",7.0
Monica,6.0,The Nap Partners,Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?,7.0
Monica,6.0,The Nap Partners,"Well, you broke up with julie grath! How much weight could she have gained?",7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,A hundred and forty-five pounds.,7.0
Monica,6.0,The Nap Partners,In one year?! My god what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.,7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!",7.0
Monica,6.0,The Nap Partners,"Well that's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.",7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.",7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!,7.0
Monica,6.0,The Nap Partners,"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!",7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,"Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're monica! Okay? And I am in love with monica.",7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.,7.0
Monica,6.0,The Nap Partners,Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?,7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,I'd carry you around in my pocket.,7.0
Chandler,6.0,The Nap Partners,Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.,7.0

Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.",7.0
Phoebe,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Regular celery! Oh, I already have that.",7.0
Ross,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Done! With time a-to-spare.,7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Oooh that may be a new world's record,7.0
Ross,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" hmm?",7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Uh, magellan? You got 46 states.",7.0

Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Okay, but if you can'tno dinner!",7.0

Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?,7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.,7.0
Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,That's my pie!,7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Which smells delicious!,7.0
Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Uh-oh! Uh-oh!,7.0
Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"We left joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... Feeding stuffing to a dog!",7.0

Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic!",7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",7.0
Phoebe,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",7.0
Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?",7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Well, it still has to go, right?",7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Okay, it's um",7.0

Ross,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!",7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Is there a puppy here?,7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Okay, you are new!",7.0
Joey,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Look, chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like ross not likin' ice cream.",7.0
Phoebe,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,You don't like ice cream?,7.0
Ross,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,It's too cold.,7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",7.0
Ross,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,It hurts my teeth.,7.0
Chandler,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!",7.0
Ross,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my s.a.t.s.,7.0

Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?",7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?",7.0
Phoebe,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Oh, I'd say about a month.",7.0
Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Really? I'd say 3 to 4.,7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Interesting.,7.0
Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"When it's your assistant, I would say never.",7.0
Joey,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"All right, rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.",7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Huh. A moo-point?,7.0
Joey,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.",7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?",7.0
Monica,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Please, don't listen to joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.",7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.",7.0
Joey,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.",7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,How are you holding up?,7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.,7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,So were you guys together a long time?,7.0

Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.",7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?",7.0
Rachel,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.",7.0

Chandler,10.0,The Huliday Armadillo,"If you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?",7.0
Monica,10.0,The Huliday Armadillo,"It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so annoying.",7.0
Phoebe,10.0,The Huliday Armadillo,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",7.0
Monica,10.0,The Huliday Armadillo,"Phoebe, you got joey drums to annoy rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",7.0
Phoebe,10.0,The Huliday Armadillo,Maybe on some level.,7.0

Phoebe,14.0,They All Turn Thirty,"If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.",7.0
Rachel,14.0,They All Turn Thirty,"So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant",7.0
Monica,14.0,They All Turn Thirty,"Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!",7.0
Rachel,14.0,They All Turn Thirty,"No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years- oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.",7.0
Ross,14.0,They All Turn Thirty,Which is fine! Because you just turned- - twenty-eight!,7.0

Chandler,7.0,The Stain,"So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we gosnooping around her crotch?",8.0
Monica,7.0,The Stain,Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.,8.0
Chandler,7.0,The Stain,"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",8.0
Phoebe,7.0,The Stain,"Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.",8.0
Phoebe,7.0,The Stain,Maybe this is too weird.,8.0

Chandler,8.0,The Stripper,"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.",8.0
Monica,8.0,The Stripper,"So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as aa two month anniversary present.",8.0
Ross,8.0,The Stripper,"Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!",8.0
Monica,8.0,The Stripper,Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!,8.0
Chandler,8.0,The Stripper,All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!,8.0

Chandler,8.0,The Stripper,"Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?",8.0
Joey,8.0,The Stripper,"Maybe monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.",8.0
Chandler,8.0,The Stripper,"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.",8.0
Joey,8.0,The Stripper,I bet ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.,8.0
Chandler,8.0,The Stripper,"Oh actually, I'd rather youyeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.",8.0

Rachel,3.0,The Pediatrician,"Hi, my name is rachel green, I have an appointment for emma.",9.0
Ross,3.0,The Pediatrician,Thanks doctor.,9.0

Chandler,3.0,The Pediatrician,How far outside?,9.0

Monica,3.0,The Pediatrician,"I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my god chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.",9.0
Chandler,3.0,The Pediatrician,What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?,9.0
Monica,3.0,The Pediatrician,"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you monday before you go to work, and I see you thursday when you get back, and I always work late on tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.",9.0
Chandler,3.0,The Pediatrician,I think you should take the job.,9.0

Rachel,3.0,The Pediatrician,"Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.",9.0
Ross,3.0,The Pediatrician,"Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'ah look, it's my favorite patient!'",9.0
Chandler,3.0,The Pediatrician,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?,9.0
Ross,3.0,The Pediatrician,"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!",9.0
Chandler,3.0,The Pediatrician,That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!,9.0
Ross,3.0,The Pediatrician,It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!,9.0
Phoebe,3.0,The Pediatrician,Why did you go along with that?,9.0
Phoebe,3.0,The Pediatrician,"That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?",9.0

Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.",9.0
Ross,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job.",9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Ross, you know what? She may need one..we're just going to have to make our peace with that!",9.0

Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.",9.0
Ross,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want monica and chandler.",9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,I can't believe you'd want us to raise emma.,9.0

Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"See look amy, we're a lot closer to monica and chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child.

Ross,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.,9.0
Joey,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"No, honey, its. Thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",9.0

Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,That was me.,9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.,9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.",9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. And lets face it you have fun.",9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"No, if crazy plate lad.. If monica dies then I would get emma, right?",9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Well actually...,9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Actually what?,9.0
Ross,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Well.. Its just. Its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.",9.0
Joey,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Uh.. Who has to die for me to get her?,9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"So if monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise emma?",9.0
Ross,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"No, that that is not what we're saying.",9.0
Joey,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. Am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. You're more the fun parent.",9.0
Ross,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. Uh discliplinarin.. Someone who can be firm and strict.,9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Thats not how you see me, is it?",9.0
Phoebe,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,No you're all about the fun.,9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?",9.0
Ross,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. You're strongest when.. When you're together.",9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Ok. So if we both had emma and I die she'd have to give her up.,9.0
Ross,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Sure, monica would have to give her up.",9.0
Joey,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"I lie better then that, right?",9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"So.. Let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get emma. Then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",9.0
Phoebe,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,There's your movie!,9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?,9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom.,9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.",9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,No you learn these things. You grow into it.,9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.",9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... At the fun parts and the hard parts.,9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""go to your room! You're grounded""?",9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Can you hear me say ""you're grounded""?",9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,You said that to me last week.,9.0
Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.,9.0
Joey,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,The producer from days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet santa!,9.0
Phoebe,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,9.0
Joey,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.",9.0
Phoebe,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Ooh, what happened?",9.0

Monica,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.,9.0
Ross,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.",9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get joey.",9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Yeah.. Yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?,9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,What? What carrer?,9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.,9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.,9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving emily to you.,9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.,9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?",9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.",9.0

Joey,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.,9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.",9.0
Rachel,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,"Mon, I'm so sorry.",9.0
Chandler,8.0,Rachel's Other Sister,Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.,9.0

Monica,10.0,Christmas In Tulsa,What else did you think about?,9.0
Chandler,10.0,Christmas In Tulsa,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff.

Monica,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.,9.0
Ross,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.",9.0

Rachel,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Hey, listen, joey, about molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.",9.0
Rachel,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.",9.0
Joey,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.",9.0

Chandler,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,You don't trust him?,9.0
Ross,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Wh - no. Some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"".",9.0
Chandler,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.",9.0
Ross,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?",9.0
Chandler,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.",9.0
Ross,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.",9.0

Chandler,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,Your thoughts? Plural?,9.0
Joey,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!",9.0
Chandler,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, joe.",9.0
Joey,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Now you're telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... Like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did ross tell you not to let me go over there?",9.0
Chandler,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",9.0

Phoebe,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're bob's favorites.",9.0
Phoebe,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,You must think I'm crazy.,9.0
Phoebe,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... Let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... When I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have i?",9.0
Rachel,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?",9.0

Rachel,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"See, gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?",9.0
Rachel,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,Well monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.,9.0
Rachel,12.0,Phoebe's Rats,"See? Why, gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... And you do that ...",9.0

Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Hey, you're not naked! So hey, rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.,9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Bye! Hey, I hope emma isn't making it too hard on you.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"No, hey, it's been great.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah, that'll do it.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Wow! So, how are you?",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"I'm, I'm okay.",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, actually it...",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Wow, really?",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Sure, I know lots of girls.",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,Yeah? Any names come to mind?,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,What you got?,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.",9.0

Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh my god, rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,Why are they doing this?,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yes, and they should name one of their kids joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Ooh, that's a great plan!",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh.""",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch emma tonight.,9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, phoebe set me up on a date.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,Why? What's the big deal?,9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Just figured, 'cause you and ross are...",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"You want a job? Turn off ""oprah,"" and send out a resume!",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?,9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh, it's perfect.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight.,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,All right! Who is he?,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for ross.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh my god, you're right!",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,She even reads for pleasure!,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,How do you even know a woman like that?,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,So now what do we do?,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,Ooh...i hear that's bad.,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Ah, yes, the plan!",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"It's not santa's plan. No, it's...",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"No, I think we killed it.",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle chandler; funny is all I have!",9.0

Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,I don't do that.,9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,Today is the sixth.,9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"No, it's not.",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yes, it's also 2003.",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.,9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.,9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.,9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,I am not working. There's not much to do around here!,9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"So, let's do this.",9.0

Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,Because of emma.,9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh my god, emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... Canoodling in it.",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the b-a-b-y.",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...",9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?,9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,I guess you're right.,9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?,9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.",9.0

Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,Really? What's that like?,9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Now, come on, come on, steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,He's not stoned.,9.0

Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Yeah, four times.",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"My dear, sweet rach.",9.0

Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.",9.0

Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"You can't have s-e-x, when you're taking care of the b-a-b-i-e!",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.",9.0

Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to rachel.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,Don't touch my coat!,9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Hey, rach, how's it going?",9.0

Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"No, we weren't!",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,Don't you lie to me! I could tell by chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?,9.0
Chandler,14.0,The Blind Dates,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell rachel about this.,9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,"No, please don't. Please, joey. She will kill us!",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Hey, I gotta! Unless...",9.0
Monica,14.0,The Blind Dates,Unless what?,9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,Unless you name your firstborn child joey.,9.0

Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,Monica told me you had a blind date.,9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?,9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,Why does everyone keep saying that?,9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,Female body inspector? What size is that?,9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child joey?",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,9.0

Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.",9.0
Rachel,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.",9.0
Ross,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.",9.0
Joey,14.0,The Blind Dates,"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.",9.0
Phoebe,14.0,The Blind Dates,"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.",9.0

Chandler,17.0,The Memorial Service,"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time?

Ross,17.0,The Memorial Service,"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?",9.0
Chandler,17.0,The Memorial Service,"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?",9.0

Chandler,17.0,The Memorial Service,I didn't know ross and you were so close.,9.0
Chandler,17.0,The Memorial Service,"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",9.0
Ross,17.0,The Memorial Service,"But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!",9.0

Ross,17.0,The Memorial Service,"No mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between chandler and me, but it's over, ok? Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?",9.0

Chandler,18.0,The Lottery,"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?",9.0

Rachel,18.0,The Lottery,I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.,9.0
Ross,18.0,The Lottery,"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""daddy"" too.",9.0

Rachel,18.0,The Lottery,"Ooh, I have another idea!",9.0
Monica,18.0,The Lottery,"I'm sorry, idea time is over.",9.0

Rachel,18.0,The Lottery,"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?",9.0
Chandler,18.0,The Lottery,"She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...",9.0
Chandler,18.0,The Lottery,"Let me finish ... However, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!",9.0

Joey,21.0,The Fertility Test,"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""days"" I had to say ""frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"".",9.0
Ross,21.0,The Fertility Test,Wow. What does that mean?,9.0

Phoebe,21.0,The Fertility Test,"Uhu, uhu... And why do you think that is?",9.0

Phoebe,21.0,The Fertility Test,Tips not included.,9.0
Rachel,21.0,The Fertility Test,"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",9.0
Phoebe,21.0,The Fertility Test,"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. But you know... You pay a price. Now I'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh! Paying taxes!",9.0
Rachel,21.0,The Fertility Test,"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!",9.0

Ross,21.0,The Fertility Test,"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",9.0
Ross,21.0,The Fertility Test,"Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",9.0
Ross,21.0,The Fertility Test,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy joey is.",9.0
Ross,21.0,The Fertility Test,That was going to be my next argument.,9.0
Joey,21.0,The Fertility Test,You're ready?,9.0

Monica,21.0,The Fertility Test,Oh... What does that mean?,9.0

Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,"Ok, that'll be great!",9.0
Joey,22.0,The Donor,"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,That's not what we're gonna do!,9.0
Joey,22.0,The Donor,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!,9.0
Monica,22.0,The Donor,"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"Oh, damn it!",9.0
Monica,22.0,The Donor,"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",9.0

Ross,22.0,The Donor,So-so what did the doctor say?,9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"Well... There's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... Too hard for her.",9.0
Joey,22.0,The Donor,So you're ruling out surrogacy?,9.0
Joey,22.0,The Donor,"So, I don't have to learn what that means?",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... We're talking about sperm donors.",9.0
Joey,22.0,The Donor,"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",9.0
Ross,22.0,The Donor,How do you feel about all this?,9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,9.0
Joey,22.0,The Donor,"Come on ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",9.0
Ross,22.0,The Donor,What? No! I am not going to give them ben!,9.0
Ross,22.0,The Donor,The data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are - are staggering.,9.0
Ross,22.0,The Donor,"I mean, we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!",9.0
Ross,22.0,The Donor,"Oh, that's not what you want...",9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,"Oh, I'll take some of that.",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Pheebs, that's for men!",9.0

Rachel,22.0,The Donor,You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.,9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,"So what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie?",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Anybody! You, me, you know, monica's mom...",9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,You like joey?,9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Oh, I get it!",9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,So can we keep this between us?,9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!",9.0

Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"So, zack's pretty nice, uh?",9.0
Monica,22.0,The Donor,"Yeah, I guess.",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!",9.0
Monica,22.0,The Donor,"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!",9.0
Monica,22.0,The Donor,I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,9.0
Monica,22.0,The Donor,"Tell me about yourself, zack!",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Oh, god, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!",9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Oh, thank god I can't hear a word that you're saying!",9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,I didn't say anything yet!,9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Well, get back in there and talk!",9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,I'm rachel. It's so annoying when I put emma on the phone to talk with my friends.,9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,"Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!",9.0
Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,Ooh! We have a problem.,9.0

Joey,22.0,The Donor,"Well, just wake him up!",9.0
Ross,22.0,The Donor,"I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!",9.0
Joey,22.0,The Donor,"Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... No wait a minute... It was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?",9.0

Phoebe,22.0,The Donor,"Oh! I'm sorry rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat mike at ""who's more over who""!",9.0
Rachel,22.0,The Donor,"Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?",9.0

Monica,22.0,The Donor,Does seem pretty perfect.,9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!",9.0
Monica,22.0,The Donor,"No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... He's not you.",9.0
Chandler,22.0,The Donor,"Yeah, he's better!",9.0

Phoebe,23.0,In Barbados,"You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for chandler are certainly gone!",9.0
Chandler,23.0,In Barbados,I wouldn't read too much into it.,9.0
Chandler,23.0,In Barbados,"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.",9.0
Chandler,23.0,In Barbados,"Seriously, we're gonna do this?",9.0
Chandler,23.0,In Barbados,"Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?",9.0

Chandler,23.0,In Barbados,David is going to propose to phoebe.,9.0
Chandler,23.0,In Barbados,"Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and I told him that phoebe wanted to get married.",9.0
Monica,23.0,In Barbados,"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?",9.0
Chandler,23.0,In Barbados,"I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?",9.0
Monica,23.0,In Barbados,"They've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! She'll say ""no"", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again.",9.0
Chandler,23.0,In Barbados,"Man, that's some bad advice!",9.0
Joey,23.0,In Barbados,Oh! Hey! Thank god you guys are here!,9.0
Rachel,23.0,In Barbados,Hey! Hey what's going on?,9.0
Joey,23.0,In Barbados,"Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous!",9.0

Monica,15.0,Estelle Dies,"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.",10.0
