oh god... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and i was looking at this gravy boat. this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat. when all of a sudden- sweet 'n' lo?- i realized that i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry! and then i got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much barry looks like mr. potato head. y'know, i mean, i always knew looked familiar, but... anyway, i just had to get out of there, and i started wondering 'why am i doing this, and who am i doing this for?'. so anyway i just didn't know where to go, and i know that you and i have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person i knew who lived here in the city. who wasn't invited to the wedding. ooh, i was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...scene: monica's apartment, everyone is there and watching a spanish soap on tv and are trying to figure out what is going on.] now i'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. tuna or egg salad? decide! i'll have whatever christine is having. daddy, i just... i can't marry him! i'm sorry. i just don't love him. well, it matters to me! if i let go of my hair, my head will fall off. ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. i say push her down the stairs. push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs! c'mon daddy, listen to me! it's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe? what if i wanna be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i'm not saying i want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying i am a ha- it's a metaphor, daddy! you can see where he'd have trouble. look daddy, it's my life. well maybe i'll just stay here with monica. well, i guess we've established who's staying here with monica... well, maybe that's my decision. well, maybe i don't need your money. wait!! wait, i said maybe!! just breathe, breathe.. that's it. just try to think of nice calm things... raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... la la la la...something and noodles with string. these are a few... i'm all better now. i helped! okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? independence. taking control of your life. the whole, 'hat' thing. and hey, you need anything, you can always come to joey. me and chandler live across the hall. and he's away a lot. joey, stop hitting on her! it's her wedding day! what, like there's a rule or something?

well, i was kinda supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing! right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, god.. no, no, although, aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture. yes, and we're very excited about it. well actually thanks, but i think i'm just gonna hang out here tonight. it's been kinda a long day. okay, sure. hey pheebs, you wanna help? oh, i wish i could, but i don't want to. love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. la-la-la-la-la- thank you. la-la-la-la...ohhh! i'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. i have no brackety thing, i see no whim guys whatsoever and- i cannot feel my legs. i'm thinking we've got a bookcase here. it's a beautiful thing. what's this? i would have to say that is an 'l'-shaped bracket. which goes where? i have no idea. done with the bookcase! all finished! this was carol's favorite beer. she always drank it out of the can, i should have known. hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here. yes, please don't spoil all this fun. ross, let me ask you a question. she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv- what did you get? you guys. oh, god. you got screwed. oh my god! oh my god! i know, i know, i'm such an idiot. i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. i mean, how clean can teeth get? my brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. how did you get through it? well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her- -leg? that's one way! me, i- i went for the watch. you actually broke her watch? wow! the worst thing i ever did was, i-i shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel. ooh, steer clear of you. that's right.scene: monica's apartment, rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.] barry, i'm sorry... i am so sorry... i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and i ju- hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, i know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become mrs. barry finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. and not that i have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... i'm divorced! i'm only 26 and i'm divorced! shut up! you must stop! that only took me an hour. look, ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento. you, however have had the love of a woman for four years. four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! i don't think that was my point! you know what the scariest part is? what if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? i mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her... what are you talking about? 'one woman'? that's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. lemme tell you something, ross. there's lots of flavors out there. there's rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing! cherry vanilla. you could get 'em with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! this is the best thing that ever happened to you! you got married, you were, like, what, eight? welcome back to the world! grab a spoon! i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny. stay out of my freezer!scene: a restaurant, monica and paul are still eating.] ever since she walked out on me, i, uh... what?..... what, you wanna spell it out with noodles? no, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation. oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date? isn't there? yeah... yeah, i think there is. -what were you gonna say? well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, i haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...sexually. oh god, oh god, i am sorry... i am so sorry... it's okay... i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. um... how long? two years. wow! i'm-i'm-i'm glad you smashed her watch! so you still think you, um... might want that fifth date? ...yeah. yeah, i do. we are gathered here today to join joanne louise cunningham and charles, chachi-chachi-chachi, arcola in the bound of holy matrimony. oh...see... but joanne loved chachi! that's the difference! grab a spoon. do you know how long it's been since i've grabbed a spoon? do the words 'billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? great story! but, i uh, i gotta go, i got a date with andrea--angela--andrea... oh man, angela's the screamer, andrea has cats. right. thanks. it's june. i'm outta here. y'know, here's the thing. even if i could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am i gonna ask? isn't this amazing? i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life. that is amazing. congratulations. y'know, i figure if i can make coffee, there isn't anything i can't do. if can invade poland, there isn't anything i can't do. listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a western omelet or something... although actually i'm really not that hungry... oh good, lenny and squigy are here. morning. good morning. morning. morning, paul. hello, paul. hi, paul, is it? thank you! thank you so much! stop! no, i'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in witness. we'll talk later. yeah. thank you. that wasn't a real date?! what the hell do you do on a real date? shut up, and put my table back. okayyy! all right, kids, i gotta get to work. if i don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... so, like, you guys all have jobs? yeah, we all have jobs. see, that's how we buy stuff. yeah, i'm an actor. wow! would i have seen you in anything? i doubt it. mostly regional work. oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the reruns' production of pinocchio, at the little theater in the park. look, it was a job all right? 'look, gippetto, i'm a real live boy.' i will not take this abuse. you're right, i'm sorry. ""once i was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."" you should both know, that he's a dead man. oh, chandler? so how you doing today? did you sleep okay? talk to barry? i can't stop smiling. i can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. i know, he's just so, so... do you remember you and tony demarco? oh, yeah. well, it's like that. with feelings. oh wow. are you in trouble. big time! want a wedding dress? hardly used. i think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. okay. okay. i am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. or else i'm just gonna get up and go to work. oh, look, wish me luck! what for? i'm gonna go get one of those job things. hey, monica! hey frannie, welcome back! how was florida? you had sex, didn't you? how do you do that? oh, i hate you, i'm pushing my aunt roz through parrot jungle and you're having sex! so? who? you know paul? paul the wine guy? oh yeah, i know paul. you mean you know paul like i know paul? are you kidding? i take credit for paul. y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. of course it was a line! why?! why? why, why would anybody do something like that? i assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'. i hate men! i hate men! oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe. is it me? is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? all right, c'mere, gimme your feet. i just thought he was nice, y'know? i can't believe you didn't know it was a line! guess what? you got a job? are you kidding? i'm trained for nothing! i was laughed out of twelve interviews today. and yet you're surprisingly upbeat. you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale, fifty percent off! oh, how well you know me... they're my new 'i don't need a job, i don't need my parents, i've got great boots' boots! how'd you pay for them? uh, credit card. and who pays for that? um... my... father. oh god, come on you guys, is this really necessary? i mean, i can stop charging anytime i want. c'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life. i know that. that's why i was getting married. give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. thank you. you're welcome. i remember when i first came to this city. i was fourteen. my mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and i got here, and i didn't know anybody. and i ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel. the word you're looking for is 'anyway'... all right, you ready? no. no, no, i'm not ready! how can i be ready?

1.0,2.0,The Sonogram At The End,"what you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. yeah, right!.......y'serious? oh, yeah! everything you need to know is in that first kiss. absolutely. yeah, i think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? i mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out. yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. yeah, well, word of advice: bring back the comedian. otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. ....are we still talking about sex? no, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? well, she has issues. does she. he's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! marsha, these are cave people. okay? they have issues like 'gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' see? speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? no. no. yes, it is. carol! hi! okay, okay, yes, it is. how about i'll, uh, catch up with you in the ice age. hi. so. you look great. i, uh... i hate that. sorry. you look good too. ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... so what's new? still, uh... a lesbian? well... you never know. how's, um.. how's the family? marty's still totally paranoid. oh, and, uh- why- why are you here, carol? i'm pregnant. pregnant?! oh, i think this is the episode of three's company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. ...then i've already seen this one! are you through with that? yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. whose little ball of paper is this?! oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised i didn't need it, so i balled it up and... ...now i wish i was dead. she's already fluffed that pillow... monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine! look , i'm sorry, guys, i just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. monica- hi! um, monica, you're scaring me. i mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. and not-not in a good way. yeah, calm down. you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. that's because as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong. y'see, he's the prince. apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born. ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! what? ugly naked guy got a thighmaster! eeaagh! has anybody seen my engagement ring? yeah, it's beautiful. oh god, oh god, oh god oh god oh god oh god.... no, look, don't touch that! oh, like i wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'hi barry! remember me? i'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' oh god and now i'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... easy rach, we'll find it. won't we! oh! yeah! alright, when'd'ya have it on last? doy! probably right before she lost it! you don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... i know i had it this morning, and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with... ...dinah? ohhhhh, don't be mad... you didn't. oh, i am sorry... i gave you one job! oh, but look how straight those noodles are! now, monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... i just... can't do it. boys? we're going in. .....hi. wow. that is not a happy hi. carol's pregnant. ooh! i found it! w-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... yeah. do that for another two hours, you might be where i am right about now. kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon? well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved, but if i'm not comfortable with it, i don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. she is so great! i miss her. what does she mean by 'involved'? i mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. so what are you gonna do? i have no idea. no matter what i do, though, i'm still gonna be a father. .....well, this is still ruined, right? oh, martha ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. mmm! what's that curry taste? curry. mmmm! i- i think they're great! i, i really do. do you remember the ludwins? the big one had a thing for you, didn't she? they all had a thing for him. aw, mom... i'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... i don't know. anyway, i told her you had a restaurant- no mom, i don't have a restaurant, i work in a restaurant. well, they don't have to know that... ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? yeah. oh, we're having spaghetti! that's.... easy. i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? because i think it might take some of the heat off me. what that rachel did to her life.... we ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well. i'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money! well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... what's that supposed to mean? nothing! it's an expression. no it's not. don't listen to your mother. you're independent, and you always have been! even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! and you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... look, there are people like ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. other people are satisfied with staying where they are- i'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer. ...and i read about these women trying to have it all, and i thank god 'our little harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. so, ross, what's going on with you? any stories? no news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? okay! okay. look, i, uh- i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. carol's a lesbian. she's living with a woman named susan. she's pregnant with my child, and she and susan are going to raise the baby. and you knew about this?! your folks are really that bad, huh? well, y'know, these people are pros. they know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. boy, i know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -i'd want yours. must pee. y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. you're twins? yeah. we don't speak. she's like this high-powered, driven career type. what does she do? she's a waitress. all right, you guys, i kinda gotta clean up now. chandler, you're an only child, right? you don't have any of this. well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. the lights, please.. ...how long was i in there? i'm just cleaning up. d'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? uh.. okay, sure! thanks! anyway.. um.. so, you- uh- you nervous about barry tomorrow? oh.. a little.. mm-hmm.. a lot. mm. so, got any advice? y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, i know it'll be hard. or, y'know, uh, hey!, i'll go down there, and i'll give barry back his ring, and you can go with carol and susan to the ob/gyn... oh, you've got carol tomorrow.. when did it get so complicated? got me. remember when we were in high school together? yeah. i mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..ross? yes, yes! oh! man, i never thought i'd be here.. me either... sorry i'm late, i was stuck at work. there was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. hi. ross, you remember susan. how could i forget?

what, what, what is it with you and this holiday? all right, i'm nine years old. oh, i hate this story. we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have--and i remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. oh my god. yes. it's very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. uh, hi. we uh, we used to work together. we did? yeah, at macy's. you were the obsession girl, right? i was the aramis guy. aramis? aramis? yeah, right. i gotta tell you. you're the best in the business. get out. i'm serious. you're amazing. you know when to spritz, when to lay back. really? you don't know what that means to me. ooh, you smell great tonight. what're you wearing? nothing. listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something? yeah. oh. what's wrong? i just remembered, i have to do something. oh. what? um, leave. wait, wait, wait! so i guess you all saw it. saw what? no, we were just laughing. you know, how laughter can be infectious. set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd. tonight, on a very special blossom. mmm, looking good. ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. what? i don't know. it's just not the same without mom in the kitchen. all right, that's it. you know what? just get out of my way and stop moping. that's closer. i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop. oh, you must stop shooping. ok, i'm gonna get my stuff. chandler, will you just come in already? no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment. look out, incoming pumpkin pie! ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore. hey, monica, i got a question. i don't see any tater tots. that's not a question. but my mom always makes them. it's like a tradition. you get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! it's bad enough i can't be with my family because of my disease. all right, fine. tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots. ok, i'm off to talk to my unborn child. ah! ok, mom never hit. ok, all done. what, phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? ross needs lumps! oh, i'm sorry, oh, i just, i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. why would we do that? well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died. ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up. ok, good-bye you guys. thanks for everything. oh, sorry! oh, sorry! the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away. the balloon? no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it's all over the news. right before he reached macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park. i'm goin' to the roof, who's with me? i can't, i gotta go. come on. an 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen? almost never. got the keys? or got the keys! ok. anytime you're ready. ok, ok, here we go. ok, where am i talking to, here? i mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... just aim for the bump. ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. you know, i, you know, can't do this. uh, this is too weird. i feel stupid. so don't do it, it's fine. you don't have to do it just because susan does it. hello, baby. hello, hello. i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park. yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? i mean, that was just mean. ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. why are we standing here? we're waiting for you to open the door. you got the keys. no i don't. yes, you do. when we left, you said, ""got the keys."" no i didn't. i asked, ""got the ke-eys?"" no, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"". do either of you have the keys? the oven is on. oh, i gotta get my ticket! wait, wait, we have a copy of your key. well then get it, get it! that tone will not make me go any faster. joey! that one will. and everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. so, on a dare, i picked paleontology. and you have no idea what i'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. you're just happy you don't have gills anymore. look, you don't have to talk to it. you can sing to it if you want. oh, please. i am not singing to your stomach, ok? hi, how's it goin? shh! here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. hey, hey! hey, uh, did you just feel that? i did. does it always, uh--? no, no that was the first. keep singing! keep singing! hey, hey, you're my baby, and i can't wait to meet you. when you come out i'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo. i felt it! hey, hey, i'm your daddy. i'm the one without any breasts. nope, not that one. can you go any faster with that? hey, i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. you do the math. why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway? for an emergency just like this. all right, listen, smirky. if it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, i would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. but i'm not. i swear you said you had the keys. no, i didn't. i wouldn't say i had the keys unless i had the keys, and i obviously didn't have the keys. ooh, ok, that's it. enough with the keys. no one say keys. why would i have the keys? aside from the fact that you said you had them? but i didn't. well, you should have. why? because! why? because! why? because everything is my responsibility? isn't it enough that i'm making thanksgiving dinner for everyone? you know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so i'm making different kinds of potatoes. does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want? nooooo, no, no! just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions, and mario gets his tots, and it's my first thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and i... i... ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. here we go. well, the turkey's burnt. potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined. here we come, walkin' down the- this doesn't smell like mom's. no, it doesn't, does it? but you wanted lumps, ross? well, here you go, buddy, ya got one. oh, god, this is great! the plane is gone, so it looks like i'm stuck here with you guys. hey, we all had better plans. this was nobody's first choice. oh, really? so why was i busting my ass to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner? you call that delicious? stop it, stop it, stop it! now this feels like thanksgiving. ooh. what? ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. oh my god. he's not alone. ugly naked guy's having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal. i've gotta see this. all right ugly naked guy! ooh, ugly naked dancing! it's nice that he has someone. shall i carve? by all means. ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? i don't even wanna know about the dark cheese. does anybody wanna split this with me? oh, i will. ooh, you guys have to make a wish. make a wish? come on, you know, thanksgiving. ooh, you got the bigger half. what'd you wish for? the bigger half. i'd like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked. that's so sweet. and hey, here's to a lousy christmas. and a crappy new year. here, here! bladder control problem stop wife beating hemorrhoids?

since then?! no, it's only been six years. i just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that i wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...joe. y'ever been in love? ...i d'know. then y'haven't. you're burning your tomatoes. you're one to talk. joe, your dad's in love big time. and the worst part of it is, it's with two different women. oh man. please tell me one of 'em is ma. of course, course one of 'em's ma. what's the matter with you. it's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. he's like actually some spy, working for the c.i.a. that'd be cool.... this blows! i know, i mean, why can't parents just stay parents? why do they have to become people? why do they have... why can't you stop staring at my breasts? what? what? did you not get a good enough look the other day? alright, alright. we're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. since you saw her boobies, i think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee. y'know, i don't see that happening?

why? why? why? i don't know. maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you... wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing. well, i don't know. i mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents. that that's ridiculous! i don't feel guilty for her failures! oh! so you think i'm a failure! isn't he good? nonono, thatthat's not what i was saying... y'know, all these years, i thought you were on my side. but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they'd keep liking you better! hey, i married a lesbian to make you look good! you're right! i mean you're right! it wasn't just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace, and and the weebles' cruise ship. oh, which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in. that's tough. tough stuff. c'mon, pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going. oh, okay. feel better, rachel, 'kay?

1.0,21.0,The Fake Monica,"how could someone get a hold of your credit card number? i have no idea. but look how much they spent! monica, would you calm down? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought. i know. it's just such reckless spending. i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop. that's me. oh! the yuk! ross, he's doing it again! marcel, stop humping the lamp! stop humping! now marcel, come back- come here, marcel- oh no, not in my room! i'll get him. ross, you've got to do something about the humping. what? it's, it's just a phase. well, that's what we said about joey... would you all relax? it's not that big a deal. stop it! marcel! bad monkey! what? let's just say my curious george doll is no longer curious. oh, monica. you are not still going over that thing. this woman's living my life. what? she's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! look at this, look. she buys tickets for plays that i wanna see. she, she buys clothes from stores that i'm intimidated by the sales people. she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies. you're not an artist. yeah, well i might be if i had the supplies! i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i don't. oh, monica, c'mon, you do cool things. oh really? okay, let's compare, shall we. oh, it's so late for 'shall we'... do i go horseback riding in the park? do i take classes at the new school? nooo... this is so unfair! she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother. how about joey... pepponi? no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral. joey... switzerland? plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like i'm, i dunno, this big. which i'm not. joe...joe...joe...stalin? stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar. well, it does not ring a bell with me... joe stalin. y'know, that's pretty good. might wanna try joseph. joseph stalin. i think you'd remember that! oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof. hey. hey. hi. hi, uh, yes, this is monica geller. um, i believe i'm taking some classes with you and i was wondering what they were. what are you doing?

lotsa things. which one do you think she is? may i help you? oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe. you don't observe a dance class. you dance what does she mean? i think she means 'you dance okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? people! last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. let's not have that happen again! she could be you. let's get started. five, six, a-five six seven eight... okay, i'm not getting this! i'm totally getting it! did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? what? you just click when they click. alright people, now everyone grab a partner. okay. and, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. i'm with rachel. great. it's gym class all over again. aww. well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me. why don't i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare. it's okay, it's okay, i'm here, i'm here. sorry i'm late, okay, here i am. who's the new tense girl? she's your partner. hi. i'm monica. oh. monica! ...hi. i'm mo- ...nana. monana? yeah. it's dutch. you're kidding! i-i spent three years in amsterdam. um, pennsylvania dutch. and we're dancing. a-five, six, seven, eight... hi. hey. where've you been? at the vet. she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase. apparently he's reached sexual maturity. hey! he beat ya. she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. so what does this mean? i'm gonna have to give him up. i can't believe it, ross. this sucks! i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already? i know. i know. i mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing i can't get off my leg. isn't there any way you can keep him? no, no. the vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. i've just gotta get him into a zoo. how do you get a monkey into a zoo? i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen. well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility. yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo. hey. we found her, we found the girl. what? did you call the cops? nope. we took her to lunch. ah. your own brand of vigilante justice. what?! are you insane? this woman stole from you. she stole. she's a stealer. y'know what? after you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. i mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit. yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader. ...take off their hats! popes in a volkswagen! ...i love that joke. no way. no way did you do this. monana was very brave. it was so wild. we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen. only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor! so once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts... ...they threw us out! i was thrown out of a hotel! me! go monana! well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. i get to go pour coffee for people i don't know. don't wait up. oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a broadway show. 'scuse me? there's an open call for cats. i'm thinking we go down there, sing memories and make complete fools of ourselves. whaddya say? nononononono. think who you're dealing with here. i mean, i'm not like you. i-i can't even stand in front of a tap class. well, that's just probably 'cause of your amish background. what? well, you're pennsylvania dutch, right? right. till i bought a blow dryer, then i was shunned. i-i used to be just like you. and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life. did you ever see dead poets' society? uh-huh. i thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. i mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? what was that?! it's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. i walked out of there and i thought, 'now, that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back.' and that thought scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do. wow. then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire. oh god. we didn't get into scranton. that was like our safety zoo. they take like dogs and cows. see? i don't know who this is harder on, me or him. i'd say that chair's taking the brunt. marcel! marcel! marcel, no! good boy. see, how can nobody want him? oh, somebody will. you know there already is a joseph stalin? you're kidding. apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. you'd think you would've known that! y'know, you'd think i would've. phoebe. whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be? ...flame boy. where exactly is your zoo? well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, marcel? yes. does he, uh, fight with other animals? no-no, he's, he's very docile. even if he were... cornered? well i, i don't know. why? uh, how is he at handling small objects? he can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean... how about a hammer, or a small blade? why- why- why would he need a blade? well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. otherwise it's just cruel. he- he- he got in, he- he got in to san diego. we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing... ...he's in. he's in! oh, did you hear that, marcel? san diego. san diego! you're making a big mistake here. i mean, san diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, i'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. yo- hooo! where the hell've you been? monica and i just crashed an embassy party. are you drunk?! noooo! i'm lying. i am so drunk. oh god, oh. great, monica, y'know what, you could've called, i have been up here, i've been worried... monica?

yes, she is, hold on a second, please. monana, it's for you, the credit card people. helloooo? yeah. oh my god. thanks. what? they've arrested monica. hi. hey. how are you? i'm not too bad. fortunately, blue's my colour. how-how did you know i was here? because... i'm monica geller. it was my credit card you were using. that i was not expecting. i want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in. oh. thanks. no, thank you! you have given me so much! i mean, if it wasn't for you, i would never have gotten to sing memories on the stage at the wintergarden theater! well, actually, you only got to sing 'memo-'. i just can't believe you're in here. i mean, what am i gonna do without you? who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? who's gonna take me to the big apple circus? monica, i started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the big apple circus? well, not... worried, just... wondering. there's nothing to wonder about, monica. you're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are. not necessarily... yes necessarily! i mean, i dunno what it is, maybe it's the amish thing. um, i'm not actually amish. really?

no, no, not at the moment, no, i'm not. are you? no, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me. right, yeah, i've heard that about cute doctors. no, no, really. i suppose it's because i spend so much time, you know, where i do. oh. i try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what i do. it's like uh...well, for instance, what do you do? i'm a waitress. ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if i see one more cup of coffee'... yeah. gotcha. i'm gonna go check up on your friend. ok. that's fine. so how did you know i was even here?

i mean, well, 'cause when i was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. and here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. and it's not even born yet. it's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. i'm sorry, you were fighting. where are they?

oh, that's ross's. oh... ... oh my god. he remembered. remembered what? it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can't believe he remembered! well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? oh, it's so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune. i can't believe he did this. come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? what did you just say? ahem... um... crystal duck. no, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part? f-hah.... flennin.... oh.... my god. oh, no-no-no-no-no.... that's good, just keep rubbing your head. that'll turn back time. i mean, this is unbelievable. i know. this is really, really huge. no it's not. it's small. it's tiny. it's petite. it's wee. nuh-uh. i don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again. ok, is there a mute button on this woman? i think this is so great! i mean, you and ross! d-did you have any idea? no! none! i mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so i just... : w-well, what else did he say? i mean, does he, like, want to go out with me? well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something. ross? all this time? well, i've got to talk to him. h-he's in china! the country. no, no, wait. his flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes. what about the time difference? from here to the airport? yes! you're never gonna make it! rachel, what're you gonna say to him? i-i-i don't know. well then maybe you shouldn't go. he's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait. yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now. i don't know. maybe i'll know when i see him. here, look, alright, does this help? noooo... look, all i know is that i cannot wait a week until i see him. i mean, this is just too big. y'know, i just, i've just gotta talk to him. i... i gotta... ok, i'll see you later. rachel, i love you! deal with me first!  alright! ni-chou chi-ma! ross! excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.... hi! hi. may i see your boarding pass?

i don't know, i-i guess i just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' but you... you're a giver. you're like the most generous man i ever met. i mean... you're practically a woman. uh, so, uh, rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, i mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with ross or should i just throw it out? i don't know. i don't know... i thought about it all the way there, and i thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's ross. y'know what i mean? i mean, it's ross. sure. i don't know, i mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but i'm thinking... oh, i'm thinking it'd be really great. oh my god, me too! oh! oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! y'know what the best part is? the best part is that you already know everything about him! i mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date! yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date. another good point. no, i mean, i mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. y'know, it's... you're committed. huh? well, i mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out? why isn't it working out? i don't know... sometimes it doesn't. is he not cute enough for you? no! does he not make enough money? no, i'm just.... maybe there's someone else. wha... is there? is there someone else? no! there is.. there is noone else! then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? hey, big... shhhh! ...spender. she's still asleep. so how'd it go? oh, it was amazing. you know how you always think you're great in bed? the fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. well, it's like, last night, i couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. so i had to do all this other stuff. and the response i got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! yes, i know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. it was amazing! and not just for her... uh-uh. for me, too. it's like, all of a sudden, i'm blind. but all my other senses are heightened, y'know? it's like... i was able to appreciate it on another level. i didn't know you had another level. i know! neither did i! hey, great skirt! birthday present? yeah. oh, from who? from you. i exchanged the blouse you got me. well, it's the thought. hey, doesn't ross's flight get in in a couple hours? at gate 27-b? uh, yeah. uh, monica, y'know, honey, i've been thinking about it and i've decided this- this whole ross thing, it's just not a good idea. oh, why? because, i feel like i wouldn't just be going out with him. i would be going out with all of you. oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and i don't wanna... no, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure! monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so... i am not 'so'! ok, i was a teensy bit weird at first, but... i'll be good. i promise. who is it? it's me, carl. c'mon up. behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me. seven hundred bucks! alright, you did it! do we have any fruit? man, hell of a two weeks, huh? y'know what, though? i really feel like i learned something. really? so, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing? what, are you crazy? when a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? i'm just sayin', if i see one more picture of ed begley, jr. in that stupid electric car, i'm gonna shoot myself! i mean, don't get me wrong... i'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy! i can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me. would you excuse me, please? i'm trying to have a date here. fine, just stop thinking about me. can't do it, can you? so i'm thinking about you. so what? i don't get it. what do you see in this guy, anyway? well... he happens to be a very nice... guy.... i mean, come on, buddy, get a real car! rachel, come on. give us a chance. ross, it's too hard. no, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? who cares about them. this is about us. look, i-i've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. ross, you're like my best friend. i know. if we broke up, and i lost you... whoa, whoa, whoa. what makes you think we're gonna break up? well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up? no. but... it only has to happen once. look, you and i both know we are perfect for each other, right? i mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me? i don't know... i mean, i've never looked at you that way before. well, start looking. wow. exactly! and you just know i'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic! right! you're right! heh... y'know? you know what? what? i forgot... i am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. i am so sorry! i'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... i mean- i'm sorry. i-i-i gotta go. i'm sorry. but... excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. hi. for god's sake, will you let it go? there's no rachel! oh, hey, hey, i got that. oh, thanks, sweetie. no problem. i cannot wait for you to meet my friends. really? yeah. you don't think they'll judge and ridicule me? no, no, they will. i just... uh... can't wait. come on, they're gonna love you."
2.0,1.0,Ross's New Girlfriend,"ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. ross was in love with rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and italian guys. finally chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when ross was in china on his dig, chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel. she was like, ""oh my god."" so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that ross was getting off the plane with another woman. uh-oh! so, that's pretty much everything you need to know. but, enough about us. so, how've you been? oh my god. oh my god. excuse me. move! move! emergency! excuse me! rach! oh, there you are! hi! oh, so, so, how was china, you? it was, it was great. oh, what happened? what? you're bleeding. i am? oh, look at that, yes i am. enough about me, enough about me, mr. back from the orient. come on. i wanna hear everything! everything. well, where do i start? this is julie. julie, this is rachel. these are, these aren't for you. these are for you. welcome to our country. thank you. i'm from new york. ok, well, not a problem. we'll just use them to stop the bleeding. ok. baggage claim? ok. no way! i'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with ross! oh my god. this is huge. this is bigger than huge. this is like, all right, what's bigger than huge? um, this? yes. guys, you got your hair cut. yes, yes, we did, thanks to vidal buffay.

god? it was you, pal. well, maybe it was god, doing me. look, you were right. she looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. but then i met julie, and i don't know, we're havin' a great time. and i have to say, i never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you. well, you owe me one, big guy. here's your lemonade. i didn't order lemonade. oh. well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that. but... go-go-go-go, come on! so uh, what did you find out? he said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. i'm sorry. but, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! without any outside help whatsoever. how is that the silver lining? you have to really wanna see it. ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. pheebes, you know what i'm thinking? oh, ok. how, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it? no, although now that's what i'm thinking. all right, so what were you thinking? well, i was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, i thought, maybe you'd like to do mine? ohh! no. why not?

i don't know, i just kinda ran into him last night. where? at his apartment. is this juice? whoa, whoa. and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe? oh god, i know i'm a pathetic loser. honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad. people do stupid things when they're upset. my god, if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake. hi! hi. sorry we're late but we were- well, there was touching. hey, hey ross. hey, paulo. what are you doing here?

you know it's funny, the last time paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter. all right. ok, but, but! you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and monica about it. i promise. all right. now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. but i promise none of you are gonna feel a thing. all right, that's it, i quit. what? i didn't say anything. yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person. i'm sorry. i'm sorry, phoebe. it's just a little shorter than what we had discussed. would you relax? i know what i am doing. this is how he wears it. how who wears it? demi moore. demi moore is not a he. well, he was a he in arthur, and in ten. that's dudley moore. i said i wanted it like demi moore. oh. oh! oh my god! oh my god! oh my god! oh my god! i'm sorry, i'm sorry. which one's demi moore? she's the actress that was in disclosure, indecent proposal, ghost! oh, she's got gorgeous hair. i know! how long do you want the cuffs? at least as long as i have the pants. i just got that. ok, now we'll do your inseam. how is she? it's too soon to tell. she's resting, which is a good sign. how's the hair? i'm not gonna lie to you, ross, it doesn't look good. i put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling. can we see her? your hair looks too good, i think it would upset her. ross, why don't you come on in. yeah. how're you doing? i'm okay. ooh, that bad, huh? what? look, i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. it's one of my gifts. when i saw him get off that plane with her, i really thought i hit rock bottom. but today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me. you gotta tell ross how you feel. come on. how can i just tell him? what about julie? what about her? they've only been going out for two weeks. ross has been in love with you for like 10 years. i don't know, i don't know. look, rach, rach! i've been with my share of women. in fact, i've been with like a lot of people's share of women. the point is, i've never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you. yo, paisan! can i talk to you for a sec? your tailor is a very bad man! frankie? what're you talking about? hey, what's goin' on? joey's tailor...took advantage of me. what? no way. i've been going to the guy for 12 years. oh come on! he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... what? cupping. that's how they do pants! first they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. what? ross, ross, would you tell him? isn't that how they measure pants? yes, yes it is. in prison! whatsa matter with you? what? that's not? oh my god. even mary tyler moore would've been better. i like it. i do, i think it's a ten. thank you. my hair is very amused. come on, monica, things could be worse. you could get caught between the moon and new york city. i know it's crazy, but it's true. thank you. well, i gotta go. bye. bye, rach. wait, are you leaving? yeah, that's kinda what i meant by ""bye!"" well, can i talk to you for a sec? okay. hey, when the doctor does that hernia test... that's ok. what's goin' on? well, first of all, paulo and i are not back together. it was just a stupid thing i did, and if i could go back in time and do it again, well, i wouldn't. um, second of all , what? ok. well, before i say anything, i just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then i tell you what i think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and i look like a complete idiot? no. no-no-no-no. well, then, i think, i think the guy is scum. i hate him. i mean i actually- i-i physically hate him. i always have. you are way too good to be with a guy like that. really? you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""oh my god, i'm with rachel"". you know, someone who makes you feel good, the way i am with julie. was there a second of all? no, i think that was the whole all. okay. okay. okay. i swear to god, dad. that's not how they measure pants. i was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like andie mcdowell's new haircut? oh yeah! oh, i can do that. really? you wanna do it right now? great! ok, i just wanna be really sure this time. andie mcdowell's the girl from four weddings and a funeral, right? no. no no no no no. that's rodney mcdowell. andie mcdowell is the guy from planet of the apes. oh, yeah. ok, thank you. you're welcome."

who'd you have lunch with? judy. who? julie. what?! jody! you were with julie? look, when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. and then, one thing led to another and, before i knew it, we were...shopping. oh. oh my god. honey, wait. we only did it once. it didn't mean anything to me. yeah, right. sure! really, rachel, i was thinking of you the whole time. look, i'm sorry, all right. i never meant for you to find out! oh, please, you wanted to get caught. that is not true! oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here? did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid? ok, monica. i just have to know one thing. did you go with her to bloomingdale's? oh! ok, ok, ok, i just really, uh, i just really need to not be with you right now. hi, who's this? hi, joanne. is rachel working? it's monica. yes, i know i did a horrible thing. joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? no, i don't care what steve thinks. hi, steve. hey! how did we do? oh, i tasted ben's milk, and ross freaked out. i did not freak out. why'd you freak out? because it's breast milk. it's gross. my breast milk is gross? this should be fun. no, no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it. i just, i just don't think breast milk is for adults. of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. ross, you're being silly. i've tried it, it's no big deal. just taste it. that would be no. come on. it doesn't taste bad. yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh... cantaloupe juice. exactly. you've tasted it? you've tasted it. uh huh. oh, you've tasted it. you can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true. gimme the bottle. gimme the towel. howdy. gimme a box a juice. well, they switched me over to hombre. well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. you should see this guy, chandler, he goes through two bottles a day. what do you care? you're an actor. this is your day job. this isn't supposed to mean anything to you. i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best. i don't know. maybe i should just get outta the game. they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. all right, say you do that. you know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. and then where're you gonna run? yeah i guess you're right. you're damn right i'm right. i say you show this guy what you're made of. i say you stand your ground. i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie. i'm gonna do it. all right. now go see miss kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. i don't know what else to say. well that works out good, because i'm not listening. i feel terrible, i really do. oh, i'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife? rachel, say that i'm friends with her, we spend some time together. is that so terrible? yes. it's that terrible? yes. monica, you don't get it. it's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you. me? what are you talking about? nobody could steal me from you. i mean, just because i'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. i mean, you're my...we're, we're...oh, i love you. i love you too. you guys, um i know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um i love you guys too. oh, i really needed that. look, i know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. i mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. i really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. would you just give that a chance, for me? i'd do anything for you, you know that. i'd do anything for you. wait, wait, wait, wait! mornin'. i said, mornin'. i heard ya. all right, everybody, i'm openin' the doors. you boys ready? ready. yeah, i'm ready. you idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, i'm suing! oh my god, todd! what the hell did you do? i'm sorry. i am such a doofus. i'm so sorry, i'm so sorry. my god, what happened? these new kids, they never last. sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. listen, uh, what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now?

he said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that i was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious. wow. yeah, so i said, ""ok, relax please,"" y'know, i mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. so after a looooot of talking... i convinced him. let me get this straight. he got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea. um-hum. this man is my god. hi. i didn't get a cat. oh, that's um, interesting. no, no it's not interesting. ok, it's very, very not interesting. in fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting. alright, i got it ross. you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. what? i was doing great with julie before i found out about you. hey, i was doin' great before i found out about you. you think it's easy for me to see you with julie? then you should have said something before i met her. i didn't know then. and how come you never said anything to me. there was never a good time. right, you, you only had a year. we only hung out every night. not, not, not every night. you know, and... and it's not like i didn't try, rachel, but things got in the way, y'know?

that, that is funny. that is painfully funny. no, wait. wait, yeah, that's just painful wait a minute. i thought last night was great. yeah, it was, but...i get home, ok, and i see julie's saline solution on my night table. and i'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am i doing?

i love how it crumbles. now see, your chocolate doesn't do that. no, ma'am. well, anyhoo, we should be getting our f.d.a. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for thanksgiving. see, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: easter, christmas, what have you. mmm-mmm. but, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make thanksgiving the mockolate holiday. wow. aren't you going to swallow that? just waiting for it to stop bubbling. yeah, isn't that great? mmm. well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some thanksgiving-themed recipes. you think you might be interested?

alright. ""it was summer, and it was hot. rachel was there. a lonely gray couch. 'oh, look,' cried ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. the end."" that's it? that's all you wrote? you're the worst writer in the whole world. all right, you know what? this isn't funny anymore. there's something about me on that piece of paper and i want to see it. no, you don't. all right, you know what, that's fine. if you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. i do not need to see it. what is this? ross, what is this? good luck. ok, just, just remember how crazy i am about you, ok? kind of ditzy? too into her looks? spoiled? now that's a little spoiled. he was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot. just a waitress? no, that, that was, i mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. is this over yet rach? oh! i do not have chubby ankles! no, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. look at julie's column. she is not rachem. what the hell's a rachem? is that some stupid paleontology word that i wouldn't know because i'm just a waitress. no, rach, come on. rach! rach, no, no! she's not rachel, she is, she is not, ra--rachel? my diary! my diary, that's brilliant. i should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary. you know, that's true. you'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency. i... i cannot believe ross even made this list. what a dinkus. hey, cut him some slack. it was chandler's idea. what? what? oh good, i was hoping that would come up. this was your idea? what were you thinking? all right, let's get some perspective here, ok? these things, they happen for a reason. yeah. you! all right, pheebs, back me up here, ok? you believe in that karma crap, don't you? yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle. rach! whoops! rach, hey, open up, please! when somebody does not buzz you in, ross, that means go away. that doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape. i just wanna read something. it's your pro list. not interested. ok, ok, number one: the way you cry at game shows. number two: how much you love your friends. number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. number five: how great you are with ben. number six: the way you smell. hey, ross! what are you doin'? hey, joey. you wanna open the window? oh, yeah, i do. what are you doing out there? i am, uh, i am... oh, you must be freezing. you know what you need? how about a nice steaming cup of hot mockolate? rach, come on, open up. rach, come on, come on, rach. you got to give me another chance. no. no? that's what i said. look, maybe we should go? no, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking. rach, come on, look, i know how you must feel. no, you don't, ross. imagine the worst things you think about yourself. now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you. no, but, but i wanna be with you in spite of all those things. oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, ross. i said don't go! you know what? you know what? if, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you. well, then, i guess that's the difference between us. see, i'd never make a list. i never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? maybe a little longer. now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. i've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate. doesn't matter. what? our fda approval didn't come through. something about laboratory rats. oh, gosh, i'm sorry. yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. thank you for all the trouble you went through. um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?

sure, what? ok, ok. music? the next one's dedicated to rachel from ross. rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. uh, we've just gotten a call from rachel, and she told us what ross did. it's pretty appalling, and ross, if you're listening, i don't wanna play your song anymore. why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? avery, michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out. hi, thanks for coming in again. oh, not at all. i have no morals and i need the cash. it's like i'm lookin' in a mirror. anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". they taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. here, try one. you're not allergic to anything, are you?

'course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. now she looks like soupy sales. pheebs, who's evelyn dermer? i don't know. who's soupy sales? oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello. yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument. you have some life here, sweetie. i know. and mom, i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn't marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know? i do. you didn't love barry. and i've never seen you this happy. i look at you and i think, oh, this is what i want. for...me. well, not just for you. well, what do you mean? i'm uh, considering leaving your father. all right. tell me if this is too cute. lesbian wedding, chicken breasts. oh god. i think i'm gonna be sick. why? it's not like i'm putting little nipples on them. and you had no idea they weren't getting along? none. they didn't fight a lot? no! they didn't even talk to each other. god, how was i supposed to know they were having problems? in my day, divorce was not an option. hey, look who's up. i just can't believe this is happening. i mean, when i was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. i just figured as a grownup i wouldn't have to worry about this. is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? i mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you. well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut? you know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. but in your case it's actually kinda true. that's him. damn. my mail order grandfather hasn't come yet. phoebe? yes, hi, mr. adelman. thanks for meeting me. oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting. um, do you wanna sit? oh, no, please, i spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. now uh, what can i do for you, my dear? i don't know how to say this, but i think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me. you're saying, my wife is in you? yeah. ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? well, i don't know what to tell you dear. the only thing i can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything. everything? everything. whoa, that's a lot of stuff. oh, wait, i remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time. i'm sorry, there's laughing in my head. worth a shot, huh? look at this. these are from halloween three years ago. oh, look, here's barry. did he have to come straight from the office? no, that was his costume. see, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist. um, you guys, you know when i said before, ""thank you, but i don't really need your help""? actually, what i think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."" really? weird. anyway, see, i planned everything really well. i planned and i planned and i planned. it just turns out, i don't think i planned enough time to actually do it. hey, mon, you want some help? if you want. hey. what a day. i took her everywhere. the museum of modern art, rockefeller center, statue of liberty. she's still with you? yeah. i guess she hasn't seen everything yet. i'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. oh, such a pretty face. this is so much fun, just the girls. you know what we should do? does anybody have any marijuana? god! all right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. that's fine. i never did it. i just thought i might. so, what's new in sex? oh! what's new in sex? the only man i've ever been with is your father. i'm dicing, i'm dicing, i don't hear anything. i mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but i was thinking there might be more. oh, i'm sorry. you know what? i cannot have this conversation with you. i mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell daddy. what? what do you want? do you want my blessing? no. you want me to talk you out of it? no. then what? what do you want? i guess i just figured of all people you would understand this. why on earth would i understand this? you didn't marry your barry. i did. oh. all right people, we're in trouble here. we've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. move, move, move! monica, i feel like you should have german subtitles. joey, speed it up! i'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets! monica, how did this happen? i thought you had this all planned out. do you want me to cry? is that what you want? do you wanna see me cry? sir! no sir! all right, you! no. look, i told you i am not a part of this thing. all right, look, ross. i realize that you have issues with carol and susan, and i feel for you, i do. but if you don't help me cook, i'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and i'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in ross"". all right, ball the melon. hey! how come i'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. hi. how's it going? it's goin' great. right on schedule. got my little happy helpers. fine, whatever. what's the matter? nothing. ok, everything. i think we're calling off the wedding. what? you're still gonna pay me, right? or something a little less selfish. carol, what's the matter? what happened? my parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming. oh my god. i mean, i knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. they're supposed to give me away and everything. it's ok. i'm sorry. and then susan and i got in this big fight because i said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if i couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. i don't know what to do. i uh can't believe i'm gonna say this, but i think susan's right. you do? look, do you love her? and you don't have to be too emphatic about this. of course i do. well then that's it. and if george and adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. look, this is your wedding. do it. you're right. of course you're right. so we're back on? we're back on. you heard the woman. peel, chop, devil! i can't believe i lost 2 minutes. it just seems so futile, you know ? all these women, and nothing. i feel like superman without my powers, you know? i have the cape, and yet i cannot fly. well now you understand how i feel every single day, ok? the world is my lesbian wedding. butterscotch? no one? all right, you'll be sorry later. thank you. any time. ross. you know, nothing makes god happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. friends, family, we're gathered here today to join carol and susan in holy matrimony. oh my god. now i've seen everything! whoa, she's gone. she's gone. she's gone! go ahead, get married. go, go. would you look at them? yeah, can't help but. how's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? i wrapped those bad boys. i miss rose. oh, yeah? i know it's kind of weird, but i mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now i just feel kind of alone. you know, i uh, i couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and i think it's time for you to forget about rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink? ok, that's so nice. i shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? hey, mom? having fun? oh, am i! i just danced with a wonderfully large woman. and three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. oh, i'm not saying it's something i wanna pursue, but it's nice to know i have options. there's more alcohol, right? how you doin'? ok. you did a good thing today. yeah. you wanna dance? no, that's fine. come on. i'll let you lead. ok. all right look. penis schmenis. we're all people. ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?

i wish. no. after dinner, me, her, and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out. so, i picked up a log and threw it on. or, at least what i thought was a log. oh my god!! you threw pepper on the fire! i wish. see, i guess another thing i probably should've told you about ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg. oh my god! joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire? i ran!! well, that's the best kiss i've had with anyone i've ever met in a men's room. actually, me too. op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle. oh damn, i hate that. yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes. oh, don't worry about it. no, really you're gonna freeze. no, i'm not. you're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot? some day, maybe. funny book? hmmm. oh, no, no, i just thinking about something funny i heard today. umm, mark, mark saying 'i'll see you saturday.' yeah, at the lecture, i told you that last week, you said you didn't mind. oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, i mind, umm.... oh, please tell me it's not because i'm going with mark. oh, well... oh my god!!! ross!! well, i'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him? because, he's my friend. okay, but do you really need another friend? i mean... okay, well if i stop playing with joey and chandler, can i play with mark? is that funny? am i supposed to be laughing? i don't know, you thought 'see you saturday' was funny. look honey, mark is in fashion okay, i like having a friend that i can share this stuff with. you guys would never want to go to a lecture with me. pa-haa!! i would love to go with you. really!?

you obviously want to. you think you know me so well. well, don't 'cha wanna? yeah. okay, well i do know you. that's what i said. well so? i can't. i can't. she dumped me, i mean i totally trusted her and then one day it was 'okay, bye pheebs' gone. y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun i've ever had in like all my lives. my best shoes, so good to me. i wear them everyday. down at the heel, holes in the toes. don't care what people say. my feet's best friends, pals to the end. with them i'm one hot chicky. though late one night, not much light, i.... i stepped in something icky. sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time i'll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee. we're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. for instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink.... i'm really glad we came. you're so pretty. i love you. oh. smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault. wow, that's great. oh, yeah! y'know you could totally sell this. it'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign. i..., a jingle? no, no-no-no, no. what? why not? you could make a ton of money. okay, well if i was in this for the money, i'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. you just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie. aw, you're right, you're right. i'm sorry. that's okay. all right, i'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. it's called magician box mix up. ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now. hi! hey. oh, can i borrow this? my milk's gone bad. oh, i hate that. i once had a thing of half and half, stole my car. so umm, how was your date with ginger? great. it was great. she's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness. sounds like she's got the ah, whole package. joey told you about the leg, huh? uh-huh. oh god, it freaked me out. okay, i know it shouldn't have, but it did. i mean i like her, i don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' i mean i'm the smallest person in the world aren't i? i'm the smallest person in the world. morning. actually he's the smallest person in the world. heard about the leg burnin' huh? it came up. listen, i ah, i know it's a longshot. but, by any chance did she find that funny? so i nodded off a little. nodded off!! ross you were snoring. my father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks! come on! forty-five minutes! forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses. well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to professor pitstains and he's 'hey everybody! remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!' first of all it's professor pittain! and second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly. okay, see now, what i just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah. y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what i do, i wonder how many people would go see a movie called, jurassic parka. oh, that is so... no-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. y'know if what i do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? huh? was it so i just wouldn't go with mark? no. i... i wanted to be with you. i don't know, i feel like lately, i feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. with this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. i-i-i know it's dumb, but i hate that i'm not a part of it. it's not dumb. but, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. y'know what i mean? i mean it's like, i-i-i like that you're not involved in that part of my life. that's a little clearer. honey see, it doesn't mean that i don't love you. because i do. i love you, i love you so much. but my work it's-it's for me y'know, i'm out there, on my own, and i'm doing it and it's scary but i love it, because it's mine. i, but, i mean is that okay? sure, i-i-i... your thinking about my leg aren't you? no. no. actually i forgot, what is the deal with that again? it's okay if it bothers you. really. i mean the only thing i need to know is: 'how much it bothers you?' because i don't like wasting my time. am i wasting my time? no. no. i don't think so. okay. it's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it. what's that? that's-that's my nubbin. what's a nubbin? it's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing. you have three nipples?

what trail? the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! you always have to think about the trail! oh, i-i don't think there's any trail. okay, okay-okay, ah, chloe works with that guy issac. issac's sister is jasmine. and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe. and phoebe's friends with rachel. and that's the trail, i did it! after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one, did that! grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion. okay. ow!!!!! ow-oh-oh! was it not pain-free? no. it was painful. oh my god , they should call it pain-zine, now with a little wax. huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad. that's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. but hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest. ow-ow-ow-ow! oh my god!!! now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips? chloe? hi.. is this about me taking your watch? you took my watch? i'm sorry, i do that. just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us? oh no. i feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know. exactly. so you didn't, didn't mention anything to issac right? oh, well i tell issac everything. you tell, of course you do. issac. issac. hey, issac. issac, hi! y'know we haven't actually met... you dog! yes, i suppose i am a dog. but issac, see i-i happen to have a girlfriend. oh right, that rachel chick from the coffee place. yeah, that's the one. listen, i don't want to hurt her. oh, hey, man i know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule. yeah. listen, can you keep this information to yourself? aw, no problem dude. y'know we got to look out for each other. we're the same, you and me. actually, no, we're not. yeah, we are. no, we're not. yeah, we are. no, we're not!! okay, we're not. right. but, we are. fine. i just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister. i can promise not to tell her again. jasmine? uh-huh. we met at phoebe's birthday party, i'm, i'm ross geller. you did a bad thing! yes, i did. very bad! very bad. very, very bad. i'm agreeing with you. did you, listen, did you happen to tell phoebe yet? no. okay, jasmine, please, please don't. i love my girlfriend very much, and i want more than anything to just work it out with her. okay? all right. thank you, thank you. but you should probably talk to my roommate, because i told him and he knows phoebe too. who's your roommate? gunther! gunther. gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place. i'm sorry. was i not supposed to? ow! oh!! ow!! ow!! ow!!! ow!!!!!!! ow-ow-ow-ow! we're all right. it's okay, it's okay. we're all right. we were just waxing our legs. off?!! for your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience. yeah, well i don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely. yeah, i-i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. i mean, come on, it's just a little wax. oh yeah, come here. oh, that's mature. okay, fine, so now what, i just pull it off? uh-huh. that's right. come on, rachel, come on! talk to me! please!! i can't talk to you. i can't even look at you right now! what? nothing, nothing. rachel said everything was okay. what, what are they talking about?

nobody likes change. what? okay, okay, okay, okay. should we do something? yeah, never cheat on rachel. i'm sorry, okay, i'm sorry. i wa-i was disgusted with myself, and this morning i was so, i was so upset and then i got your message and i was so happy, and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible. whoa!! whoa, whoa, wait a minute. what time did your little friend leave? oh my god. she was there? she was still there? she was in there, when i was in there?! listen. oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me! and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! look, i didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. i thought we were broken up. we were on a break! that, for all i knew would, could last forever. that to me is a break-up. you think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality? look, i'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. i thought our relationship was dead! well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake! y'know what, i don't think we should listen to this anymore. what, what are you doing?

all right. let's say i had slept with mark. would you have been able to forgive me? yes i would. you'd be okay if you knew that mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me? yes. you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were.... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! okay, okay, yeah, i would have been devastated but, i would still want to be with you. because it's, i mean it's you. ohhhhh! what?

i mean is it the constant swearing? because i gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass! no, no. it-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock. oh? oh, and don't get me wrong, i appreciate the sentiment. it's just that i, i have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous. well, say no more. y'know it takes guts to bring this up. bing! you're okay. okay. ha! ahhhhhhh! ahhhhh! okay. would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?

no. no! hello, rachel. well, not at first. what is she doing here? i don't understand! last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.' well, i think i judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level. well, last time i almost got fired. you must end it, you must end it now! oh, come on! it's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! i mean usually i'm pretty much just in there by myself. chandler!! promise me, you will end it. okay, i promise, i'll end it. thank you. i hope you know what i'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what i mean. yeah-eh-eah! oh-oh, sorry, i-i knew what he meant. how's the hired help?

oh, well richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. then i heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, i assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. though, at least that would be something. oh my god! did you hear that? she hired me because she thinks i'm good. okay, i didn't hear that. oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks i'm good. wow! and hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian! good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house? uhhhh. do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? no! no. but ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there. actually, i'm not buying. i'm selling. let me ask you one question. do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?

even the tv? no! i'm putting that in my room. listen, joey, i know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out? back when you and rachel were together, if chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out? that's a good point. so uh, how long are you gonna punish him? five years. you've sentenced him?! hey! don't do the crime if you can't do the time. joey, the guy's your best friend. no, was my best friend. anyway, i don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. with him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open. oh, who? me? yeah! wow! i'm honored! and y'know what i'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend? what? i'm gonna get you to talk to chandler. all right. but if you weren't my best friend. oh my god, is it really that bad?

do you want me to say that i'll stop seeing her? look, it's not about her. okay? but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. and i don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. so, i'll see ya. hey, look, i know what it is to be a friend, i just-i just screwed up! yeah! you did! and that's why i'm leaving. all right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! okay, they have had a very difficult year! what with the robbery and all! when that guy was robbing us, and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what i was doing in there all that time? i was thinking about how i let you down! what? yeah! but if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, i wouldn't have worried about it so much! see you around! all right, wait! come on! just wait one second! there has to be something that i can do! something! if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down. what? we've got a box. last time i saw you, it was the morning i left for college. and you were just standing outside the dairy queen. i was probably waiting for it to open. i gotta tell you, you look great now. you look great too. you're an excellent patient! so how does it look?

uh. no way! i was gonna have thanksgiving at my girlfriend's. oh. but we broke up. oh. she-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment. oh. so you made her walk the plank? aye, matie? you're not wearing the patch yet. i know. he's coming here for thanksgiving! i know, it's sick. why is it sick? because it's richard's son! it's like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner! hey, come on, phoebe, you understand don't you? yeah, i can see where i'd be your best shot but, no. i'm sorry, but i think it's twisted. yeah. what's twisted? me going out with richard's son. ewwwww!! ew! ew! ew! sounds like a really bad idea to me. is he okay in there? he's fine! hey, y'know, mon, if things wrong out between you and richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather. fine! judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!! so now, what exactly is the point of the box? chandler? the meaning of the box is three fold. one , it gives me the time to think about what i did. two , it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey. and three , it hurts! oh hey! hey uh, you remember the necklace i gave you last year? can i see it? why? i just wanna check something. okay. now, we'll see. air hole! air hole!! here it is! i love it. i wear it all the time. the necklace i got you was gold, this one is silver. huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. oh my god! you actually exchanged it! well isn't it better that i exchanged it for something that i enjoy and that i can get a lot of use out of?

yeah. well, those were seals, man. hey mon, little question for ya! how do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer? okay, the owner of allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead i made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!! oh my god!! you just ruined the thing i was practicing the whole way home, but i'm soo happy! can you believe it? i finally get to run my own kitchen! ohh, you've waited soo long. hey! hey, pheebs, quick question for ya. yeah. how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdale's? i don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and you got the job!! yes!!! you got the job?! why didn't you tell me? ohh, it's gonna be so great! i'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, i'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. i'm gonna have walls! okay, is this the day of good news or what? i got us a job! the wedding reception. ohh! umm, phoebe, i kinda need to talk to you about that. umm, well i-i-i think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering. but we've only had one job. i know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know? yeah! what are you saying? i got offered the head chef job at allesandro's. what? it's okay, 'cause y'know what? you don't really need me for the business. you're the cook! with out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money! all right. but umm, i-i-i'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van. for what? i can't believe this! i gotta get out of here. phoebe, wait a minute! i'm an assistant buyer!! all right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out. yeah, all right. okay. so, we're having fun, right?

yeah, but uh, i don't want to be up too late, so uh, i'll have a decaf. yeah, me too. actually, can i get some hot water with a little lemon? i think i strained my voice screaming in there. does it have to be so loud? i can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad. i'm just glad i brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? i used them as mittens, i didn't want to touch a thing in that last place. how sad are we? yeah, i know. y'know what? we're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. y'know? i'm 29 years old, damnit! and i want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour! yeah! yeah! and i like to hang out in a quiet place where i can talk to my friends. yeah! and so what if i like to go home, throw on some kenny g, and take a bath! we're 29, we're not women. ohh, here you are. y'know, i'm-i'm glad you decided to hear me out. okay, i'm hearing. i've been doing a lot of thinking. a lot! and umm, well, i came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. okay umm, you could be flower delivery person. what?! or! a bakery delivery person. i wa-i wa-i wa pizza?! monica! all right, i've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, i'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver. no. okay. i'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either. no. y'know what, let's do the catering business. really?! are you sure? yeah, y'know i-i made a commitment to you. y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun. oh! it will be fun! ohh! yay! oh! okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. wow! you really wanted me to do something with this van. y'know what, i want you to take the chef job. really?! yeah. that's what you really want. yeah, i don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and i really don't want to be the reason i'm unhappy. thank you. besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new a-team. oh, hi mrs. lynch! is joanna in already?

no, i'm sorry. i have to go. good morning! oh, sophie, i guess you didn't hear about joanna i sure did! i'm so excited about having monica come on board with us. although i do feel bad about having fired chef emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. of course, that literally is the case for several of you. tony, carlos, marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. now, i know that monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. so without much further ado, i present to you our new head chef. umm, i just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... are you gonna kill me?"

yep, sucks! hi you! oh my god! i know, i can do more than cook. i like her. she sees smart. uhh, rachel, my parents ohh! it's so nice to meet you. hello. hi. hello. hello. well, joshua, that $500 was for groceries. what?

yes! there you go. so, have you kids eaten yet? well, we were going to do that after- i mean umm, next. well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat? oh, yeah, well yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house. so we go eat. yes. you'll wear that. we'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that. dude, i am sorry about what i said! no, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name! it's not that bad. yes it is! from now on, i have no first name. so, you're just bing? i have no name. all right, so, what are we supposed to call you? okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, clint. no way are you cool enough to pull of clint. okay, so what name am i cool enough to pull off?

what are we going to do? it's all right! everything's gonna be all right. how's it gonna be all right?! uh-huh, i see that. okay, i talked to the guy with the shovel and i found out what happened. what? what? they torn it down a few days early. all right! westminster abbey! hands down, best abbey i've ever seen. hey! okay. what do you think of the abbey, chandler? i think it's great. it's great. y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place. really?

oh, i don't know. i guess we have to eat. yeah, i do. what's the matter? i'm just bummed about the way i left things with ross. i shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. he seemed so mad at me. eh, don't be so hard on yourself. if someone i was still in love with was getting married still in love with?! yeah! i'm not in love with ross! oh. no. no. good! yeah, me neither. phoebe, i'm going to ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. not because, i'm still in love with him! i mean, hey, y'know, i like ross as much as the next guy, y'know? clearly i have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! i mean, i still have loving feelings for ross. yeah! but, i have, i have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that i'm still in love with him. y'know? i-i have sexual feelings for him, but i do love him- ohh! oh my god! oh my- why didn't you tell me?!! we thought you knew! we?! yeah, we all know! we talk about it all the time! you all know? does ross know? oh no, ross doesn't know anything. oh, i can not believe you didn't tell me! well, because we thought you knew!! it's so obvious! god, that would be like telling monica, ""hey, you like things clean."" hey! so, what are you guys in the market for? we've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards... check this out? huh? yeah. that's the stuff. what do you think? well, i don't have to buy that, ""i'm with stupid"" t-shirt anymore. well, i like it. here you go. all right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day? oh, i embarrass you? how can i answer that when i'm pretending i don't know you? he's just jealous. you'll fit right in; all londoners wear them! oh really? then how come no one here is wearing them? they're all tourists. all right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself. oh yeah? if you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? i choose the hat. good choice. thanks. okay, wait. all right, that's it, okay, i'm out of here. i am not going to be embarrassed anymore! hello? hey! i just spoke to your dad, and you know what? he seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding. we don't have to. whoa-whoa-what? you found a place? no. but, monica and i were talking, and-and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit. she said what? she said, ""if i'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."" postpone it? emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? this isn't right. i realize that people are going to be disappointed. but, i'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right. i can't ask people to do that? would you ask people to do that? don't you point your pants at me! we have no choice! anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, ross don't you understand? this is our wedding i'm talking about. the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option. this is when we're getting married. so what are you saying? it's now or never? no. i'm saying it's now. or? there's no 'or' in mind. what is wrong with these pants?!! it's not the pants. it's you that is backwards. and if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all! no, wait! emily! no, wait, stop! emily, please- hey! hi. so, did shopping make you feel any better about ross? manhattan does not have enough stores. well, i think i can help you get over him. you can? yeah. i just need you to bring me some photos of ross. um-hmm. and a small piece of chocolate. okay. and a glass of tepid water. ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree? uh, only if you have the hiccups too. yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. i just didn't feel like getting up. okay, i'm gonna show you a picture of ross. okay? and you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. all right? really focus on his flaws. i can do that. i certainly did it when we were going out. okay. umm, before we get started, i just wanna say for the record that i love ross, i think he's such a great guy. here. okay, now, close your eyes. and imagine that you're with ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. and you're-you're running your hands all over his body. and then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's- uck! hah? i don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy. okay, this is going to be harder than i thought. umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy. okay. okay? all right. so uh, now look at the picture okay. all right, and umm ow! okay, how do you feel now? well, i like you less! hey. hey. oh. sorry! no-no-no, y'know what? i really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, i mean that really wasn't cool. and if it makes you feel any better, i've had a really lousy day. me too. yeah? noo!! i've had the best day ever! dude, check this out! hey! sh-shh-shh! okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat. okay, so umm, what's your friend's name? oh, chandler. hi chandler! that's that's was oh my god! that's fergie baby!! joey says you don't really like his hat, but i think it's kinda dashing. how did you? how? how? well, i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace, right? so, i'm in my map and-and hey! hey! hi. i understand you had a little talk with emily. yes, i did! and you are welcome! am i?! and was it your idea to postpone the wedding?! umm i'm gonna go to the bathroom. wait up! hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all? she said that?! yeah. why?! i don't know, i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out. oh my god. you're even dumber than i am! excuse me? ross, how long have you been planning this wedding? i don't know. a month? emily has probably been planning it since she was five! ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. that's what we did! we dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. thanks. but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was. i had no idea. and that-that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun. sometimes we were. come on. you gotta help me figure out what to do. okay? okay. come on. that was pretty intense huh? yeah. hey, i hope ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here! i hope he did! hello. hey, pheebs! it's joey! hey, joey! hey! ooh! ooh! i just say someone on the- that looks just like you on the subway. and i was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then i figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you. that just cost me four bucks. but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing? ohh, they're having a great time with their aunt phoebe! aunt rachel hasn't been helpful at all. so, do you miss me? kinda, but i've just been having way too much fun. so you're not homesick yet? no, i don't think so. all right, the seven of us miss you. who's seven? y'know, me, rachel, the birds, the babies ahh, the babies miss me? ooh, the pizza guy's here! what? you ordered pizza without me?! yeah. but y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the joey special. two pizzas?! yep! okay, gotta go, talk to you later. wait, well, where did you get it from?! monica, why have you brought me here of all places?! you'll see. i tell you, this wedding is not going to happen. oh god. okay? but-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? and-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles and the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? and the chairs can face this way , and you go. but-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. really, it's fine, whatever you want. it's perfect. and, i don't know, if it starts to rain well then we'll get wet. ohh. and i don't even have a date. pheebs? yeah? do you remember where the duck food is? yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. why? because i'm going to london. what?! what do you mean you're going to london? yeah, i have to tell ross that i love him. now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until i get back. i- rachel, you can't go! ross loves emily! yeah, i know, i know, i know he does. but i have to tell him how i feel! he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision. that's not why you're going! you're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""yeah, i love you too, rach. forget that british chippy."" ohh- do you think he will?! no! because he's in love with the british chippy! look, rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! y'know, it's too late! you missed you're chance! i'm sorry, i know this must be really hard, it's over. y'know what? no. it's not over until someone says, ""i do."" i do! i do! i do! i do! ugh, like i can really chase you. i'm carrying a litter. oh...yes..is this..umm..emily's parents' house. miss waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. goodbye. joey, it's been three days, okay.. your just a little homesick, okay. would you just try to relax. just, just try to enjoy yourself."

look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, i'm sure everything will be fine. okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme? after what i did? can you blame her? oh my god! you got off easy! when my friend silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green. what is he doing? what, emily, thinks ross's furniture has got rachel coodies? now calm down joey. no! everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? emily won't let ross see rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing rachel, hence ross stops seeing us! oh, i hate this. everything's changing. yeah i know, we're losing ross, joey said hence look, i'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves. are you cool with that? no! but y'know, i'm an actor, i'll act cool. ohh, whoa god! storage rooms give me the creeps! monica, come on please hurry up honey! please? rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until i find the little waffle iron. i want the little round waffles. all right. op, here it is! right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. i wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?

well, her thought is, and i agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other. that's way uptown! that's like three trains away! which is great! i love to ride that rail! so you're really okay with this? yes! yes! i mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, i'll get so much done on the commute. i-i've been given the gift of time! now that's so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space. we should get them together and make a continuum. now he's movin'? man, what is emily doing to him? ow!! he's not even here!!! you guys! you guys! we were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man! it was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! he was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something! and he came at us with an axe, so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him! yeah, i-i-i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass! uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard? yeah! yeah, you fogged danny. please! we did not fog danny! who's danny? dan just moved in downstairs. yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the andes. nice fella. oh he's nice. he's nice! y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog! yeah? hi! you might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you. we're-we're really sorry we fogged you. okay. hi! just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something. okay. yesss? hi! sorry to bother you, but i don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it. yeah. o-kay! wow! that guy is so rude! really! what is with that guy? i mean you'd forgive me if i fogged you. well you did a little bit. oh my god, honey, i'm so sorry! i totally forgive you! really? yes! hey! hey! so listen, you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium? crematorium chris? sure! he says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm, y'know, bring in the next person i know who dies. oh my god! oh my god, look at these pelts! don't get too attached, she's having it cremated. what? uhh, phoebe, honey, honey, i know you're quirky and i get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! not nature, fashion! this is fashion?! okay, so to you, death is fashion?! that's really funny. here's phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry russia. i mean, you really thing this looks good?

i loved this place! to tell you the truth, i wish i didn't have to move. uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? well, i mean if uh, if emily gave me a choice you do have a choice!! ross, why are you listening to her?! are you, are you crazy?! why? it's not right what emily wants you to do! she is totally--owww!! stop pinching me! look, now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy, right? well he just told me that he's not entirely happy. what's going on? we all hate emily! nooo!! no, ross, we do not hate emily. we-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy. yeah! look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable. yes! yes! unreasonable! unreasonable? how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! all right, it's about compromise! do you always like it? no! do you do it? yes! because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at central perk all the time! it's real life, okay? it's what grown-ups do! i think he's right. you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much. god, i feel so guilty about ross. oh, i know. i kinda feel like it's my fault. kind of? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened. well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! well, i think it's very brave what you said. all right, i can't sit here anymore. i have to walk places. pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing? well, i've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. okay, i admit it! i love this coat! okay, i- it's the best thing i've ever had wrapped around me, including phil huntley! remember phil huntley? he was fine! hi! so you like the short hair better. what? yeti- i mean danny? i had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell. oh. listen, i'm so sorry. i would, i would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so. y'know. absolutely. some people are just into appearances. what? that's cool. cool. what? hey! no-no-no! this not cool! you don't even know me! come on, you got the shopping bags and the sack's catalog. so from that you think you've got me all figured out? well, you don't! y'know i-i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here! do you? well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with capri pants. okay. and stop saying that! i hate that! okay! fine! i judged you. i made a snap judgement. but you did it too! and you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! you can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! what does that say about you? the pizza-place across the street any good? what?! i'm hungry. wanna get some pizza? you can keep yelling if there's more. okay. okay. stop saying that. i hate that. uh, ross? are you still mad at us? yep. oh good! because we have an ""i'm sorry"" song. y'know what? i'm really not in the mood. look, ross, i feel really bad. i mean, you're going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk. yeah, we are so sorry. you're kinda stepping on the song. look, we were way out of line, we totally support you. whatever you decide, whatever you do. okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song! look, this is hard enough! i really need you guys right now. yes! exactly! and that's why why don't you come over tonight?

okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england. which i think represents the wildness of heathcliff's character. i totally get symbolism. how would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , rachel green? umm, well i would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story. well, that's sort of a given, but yes. anyone else? oh-oh-oh, symbolism! and uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which i think is-is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff's character. excellent! what rachel has shrewdly observed here you completely stole my answer! well, honey that was pretty obvious. well how would you know?! you didn't even read it! what do you think? you in the blue shirt. i think that uh, yours is a question with many answers. would ya care to venture one? would you care to venture one? are you just repeating what i'm saying? are you just repeating what i'm saying?

oh- i don't know. well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet! okay, just wait, please. i promise we'll come up with something. just give us a little more time. all right. hey, but it better make me look really, really good. oh, and another thing, the video camera?

yeah. you see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; i call it the moist maker. anyway, i-i put my sandwich in the fridge over here oh, you know what? what? i-i'm sorry. i, i-i-i believe i ate that. you ate my sandwich? it was a simple mistake. it could happen to anyone. oh-oh really? did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moist maker? no. do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it? there may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind. that said it was my sandwich?! now-now calm down. come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash. what? well, it was quite large. i-i-i-i-i had to throw most of it away. you-you-you-you threw my sandwich away! my sandwich?!!! my sandwich!!!!!! hi! hi! so umm, what's this book about? you didn't read this one either?! well, i was gonna, but i accidentally read something else. what?

umm, rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights. well, go ahead rachel. uh, thank you phoebe. umm, well, what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time. if you're talking about feminism, i think you're right. yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots. hey. hey. okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, i thought that i would give you just a little preview. you're naked in this picture! i know. ross? hey chandler. monica! ross, are you okay? i'm fine! i saw a psychiatrist at work today. why?! on account of my rage. which i may say, right now, is out of control. he gave me a pill for it. a pill? uh-huh. well, when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. and i thought was a good idea so, i took it. wait a minute, they're making you take time off work? and you're okay with that? i don't know. it's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but i, i definitely don't care about my sandwich. ugh, that was so embarrassing! i can't believe you let me go on and on like that! i'm sorry. it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop. that was not funny! well, i snapped! okay? you weren't taking the class seriously. phoebe, come on! what is the big deal? i thought this was going to be something we could do together! y'know, i thought it would be fun! well, yeah! fun is good, but y'know i also wanted to learn. y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and i never went to high school. ohh. oh, so you really wanted to learn. yeah, y'know, pheebs i just wanted to have fun. ohh, you know who you should go with?

yeah, what's going on? what's going on? i slept with monica. well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that? oh no! you slept with my sister? uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in london. this is not good for my rage. monica, is this true? of course it's true! how else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on? yes it's true. okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day? ahh- oy! that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london. right monica? i guess i wanted to keep it as a souvenir. my god monica!! are you sure joe? are you sure you're not just a sex addict? no! if anyone's a sex addict here, it's monica! yeah. yeah. she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london! so that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself. that makes sense! and the video camera?

well yeah! someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. it was the best day. your work makes me sad. oh man! i want that place so much!! i was so sure that was gonna work! there's twelve bucks i'll never see again! all right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie. bye! bye! bye chandler! i miss you already. okay, did you see that?! with the inappropriate and the pinching!! actually, i did! okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me? ohhh, oh my god! oh my god! she knows about us! are you serious? phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! that's the only explanation for it! okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps- she knows! joey! yeah?

because you can tell them that you know they know and i can go back to knowing absolutely nothing! unless no! not unless! look this must end now! oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! but see they don't know that we know that they know! so ahh yes, the messers become the messies! noooo. oh ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself! yeah, why don't you just find another apartment? look i've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one! y'know what you should do? huh? you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. yeah! like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. or uh, or my underwear. i'm listening. see? that is a great idea! and! i know ugly naked guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! oh, let's see now he had the trampoline. he broke that. well, he had gravity boots. yeah, he broke those too. so he likes to break stuff. okay, i've got to go pick up ben but i-i will figure something out. hey, didn't he used to have a cat?

the party's gonna cost you way more than that. it doesn't matter! it's my principles! we're talking about my principles! okay, i thought it was about your neighbors liking you. oh, they'll like me. once they come to my awesome par-tay! okay, i gotta run. i gotta go get some nametags. and that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law. very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of monica. i don't want you putting any ideas in her head. umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head. wh-wh-why?! well, because she loves you and because you love her. yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?! hey, chandler, don't freak out! i'm telling you something you already know! come on, she broke up with richard because he didn't want to have babies. and she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's monica. i don't see it that way. okay? because, i see two monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica, who i just started to date. now, who's to say what she wants?! i'm right. i'm right. am i right?

don't make fun of me because of my size! isn't this great? hmm. couldn't you just stay like this forever? chandler! couldn't you just stay here forever? yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. are you okay?

oh and you know what i want! yes! you want babies! you have baby fever! i do not have baby fever! oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! i've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?! have you lost your mind? chandler, this isn't about me! this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap! nah-uh! i know you! okay? i know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head! you don't know everything. did you know that i'm going out with rachel tonight instead of you? hmm? and did you know that the only baby around here is you?! and did you know that i can't even look at you right now?! well, i did not know that. it's gonna be okay, right? i mean she's not gonna leave me?

i'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. you're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. all right? y'know what? if you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. phoebe! oh, hi ross! what are you doing? oh, i thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for howard. he's just the sweetest little man! see ya phoebe! oh and hey, thanks for chipping in! you chipped in?! yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars. phoebe! i can't believe you gave them money! i thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money! yeah, but they didn't ask me! y'know? this way i'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. that's always fun to be. yeah, but you're making me look bad! no i'm not. no! if anything i'm making you look better! they'll see you talking to me and that's--i'm a hit! oh hey, pheebs! hey! oh hey, ross. umm, see, i was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because phoebe's more our kind of people. something to think about. yeah, okay, my bad. hey! hi! wow! you look, you lookbig. thanks! i've been working out. hey listen, is it obvious that i'm wearing six sweaters? uhhh, yeah. but it's not obvious why. well look, i'm breaking up with katie so i had to put on some extra padding. y'know? i mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when i tell her i'm taking away the joey love? hi! hey! hiya! hey! hey, cute jacket! oh, thanks! that's so sweet! oh! ow! oh, ow! did joey tell you to say that? you guys, are too much! whoa! y'know what katie? i gotta tell ya i-i-i-i think you are the one who is too much. ohh, joey has the nicest friends! ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! you're so sweet! ohh, you're so sweet! oww!!!! joey, she just kicked me. huh. well? aren't you gonna do something? uhh. you'd better do something, or i'm gonna walk out that door right now! well? are you gonna? nah. phoebe? that's what i'm saying. phoebe? phoebe? ooh. look, this is a disaster! can't i please just go? no! no! i'm talking you up to people. just give it a little time, all right? relax, get something to eat! okay? so uh, what did you tell them about me? oh, i was telling them about you and emily. y'know, try to get some sympathy. ohh. but somehow you came off as the bad guy. what?! yeah, i think i told it wrong. y'know, we should talk about that because i don't totally understand what happened there. ohh, this cake is really good! oh, okay, see? things are looking up already! oh my god! someone cut howard's cake! who would do a think like that? 3-b! oh yeah, aww! okay, you got your free food! you ruined everyone's fun! don't you think it's time you went home?! yeah, leave! yeah, get out! now! go back to 3-b, 3-b! all right, everyone calm down! everyone calm down! i have something that i would like to say! who here likes ross? of course you don't like him! he-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when i asked, ""who hear likes ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags! i-i'll be honest with you guys, when i first met ross i didn't like him at all! but then once i got to know him i saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. i mean, all i'm saying is don't judge ross before you get to know him all right? i mean, i like all you guys now, but when i first meet you y'know kurt, i thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm lola, mind numbingly stupid! and okay, you guys gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! so, i think you all know what i mean. obviously i didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. i just thought if i kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero. oh wow, yeah! see, i did not get that. where's monica?! where is she? i need to talk to her! it's urgent! is she here? i'm monica. i need to talk to you, it's urgent! okay. okay, i've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. and uh, well i guess there's only one-one way to do this. wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?! monica no-no, don't-don't-don't do it! will you marry me? oh-no. no. no. what a bad idea! ohhhh, i cannot look at it! chandler, why are you doing this? i don't know. but i know i'm not afraid to do this. chandler. i'm doing this because i'm sorry? do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry? no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. will you be my wife? chandler, umm, i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds. yeah, i'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now. honey! do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now! yeah i know, but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys. who? two divorces and joey?! hey! she's right y'know. yeah, but still, cheap shot! y'know what? y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? well, you're not ready for that. i didn't think i was! oh my god, what would have done if i said yes? well i would've been happy because i would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love. or, you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door. hey ross, will you pass me that knife? no, i will not! oh, it's okay. you don't have to be so mean about it. you're right, i'm sorry. will you marry me? aw, and i was gonna ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week. oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but i'm not sure, chandler? okay, how long is this going to go on. well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time. this is fun. hey rach, remember that whole ""we were on a break thing?"" well, i'm sorry, will you marry me? that's not funny. that's not funny at all!"

how you doin'? excuse me, is this your car? yeah. well i don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance. don't worry about it. it's not a problem. well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause i'm a cop. so am i! ohh, no. oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause i know that 'cause i'm a cop too. so, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. hey, wait a second! so wait, what precinct are you with? i-i'm with the umm, the 57th. oh, i know a guy in homicide up there. i'm in vice. yeah, in fact i'm undercover right now. i'm a whore. who-who else is in vice up there? umm, do you know, umm sipowicz? sipowicz? no, i don't think so. yeah, big guy, kinda bald. no, i don't know him. don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. his umm, his partner just died. wow umm, tell sipowicz i'm real sorry for his loss. i-i sure will, take care. hey by the way, i'm sure sipowicz is gonna be all right. i heard that kid from silver spoons is really good. and where did you find my badge? oh. hey! joey, would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch? oh, i'd love too, but i got acting class. but y'know what? i guess i can blow that off, for you. thanks! uh, hey, rach let me ask you something. uh, i was just over there talking to monica and chandler, boy they are really tight. i know. yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. i'm thinking of getting me one of those. what's up joe? well, the reason i think monica and chandler are so great yeah? is because they were friends first. y'know? so i asked myself, ""who are my friends?"" you and phoebe, and i saw you first. so what are you saying? i'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch. y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as i am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, i just, i-i don't think we should be cranking anything up. i'll treat you real nice. yeah, well, y'know umm no honey, listen i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. don't hit on your existing friends! won't-won't that take longer? yeah. yeah. oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait. yeah. i understand. i understand. man, i wish i saw phoebe first! come here to me. no-no, you come here to me. hey ross! i brought reinforcements. oh great! what, you brought joey? well, i brought the next best thing. hey! chandler?! you brought chandler?! the next best thing would be monica! y'know, i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so look, i-i drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. okay rach, that's you. that's the couch. whoa-oh, what's-what's that? oh, that's me. wow! you certainly think a lot of yourself. no! that's-that's my arm! oh, i see. i thought you just really, really liked your new couch. y'know what? just-just follow my lead. okay! okay. come on, chandler. all right. okay, here we go! all right, ready?

hey! hey! how's it going? did you make any new friends? yeah, yeah, i met this woman. hey, whoa-whoa! what's she like? uhh, well, she'sreally good in bed. joey, i thought you were gonna try to be friends first! well look, hey, it's all your fault! what?! why?! well because you didn't give me advice! no! you gave me a pickup line! as soon as i told her i wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. i suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! and her roommate! what about the closeness? closeness-shmoshness! there was three of us for crying out loud! all right! hey, who wants pizza?! ooh, i do! i do! i do! oh, great! can you believe i found it on the second floor? who is it? uhh, just a minute officer!! ooh, god, it's him! it's that cop! god, i can't believe it! he found me! oh my god, phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?! well, if i'm going down, i'm taking you with me. harboring a fugitive? that's one to three years minimum. good luck chandler. okay, you can arrest me. fine. but you'll never make it stick and you know it! yeah, but i kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. i mean, you understand right? yep! as long as you understand that i'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. a fool! i don't like looking foolish. y'know what? maybe uh, i don't arrest you today. maybe i came by and you weren't here. i would love it if i weren't here! okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight i was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me? me?! yeah. ever since you flashed my badge at me, i kinda can't stop thinking about you. you're the prettiest, fake undercover whore i've ever seen. wow! i didn't see that coming! you're-you're asking me out! yeah. i mean, i coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me. umm, yeah, i'd like to go out with you officer gary. gary. okay, so it's a date. yeah! so--ooh, i gotta ask you though. how did you know where to find me?

i feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore. oh wow! is that what this all have been about? wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time? yeah that was great. that was really great! but to tell you the truth, i'm more excited about where we are right now. really? yeah! i've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, i think that's pretty incredible. and the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah i think that's pretty exciting. that is so sweet. i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm, i feel the same way. yeah? yeah. y'know what i just realized? you just freaked out about our relationship. did not. yes you did! admit it! you freaked out! okay, i freaked out a little. little?! you freaked out big time! okay?

i would love to do it together! they're gonna do it together. dude! that's my girlfriend! what, so i gotta shut it down now? all right, i gotta take off. i'm picking up ben then we're off to the big audition. it's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad. yeah. weirder than watching his two moms make out? whoa-whoa dad? there's a dad in the commercial? yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it. whoa, hey, maybe i'll go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad. i mean who better to play ben's father than his godfather. you're not his godfather. what?! are you kidding?! of course i am! okay, let's go godfather. all right! hey! i'm in, they're gonna let me audition! really? that's great! i know! i know! it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so i steered clear of her hey, that kid looks familiar. oh yeah, yeah! he's done tons of commercials. i've seen him in like sugar smacks, playstation, and that one for the phone company. in fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. chandler was mad. yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. ben is way cuter than that kid. i mean look at him, look at you, that's great. listen, wouldn't it be great though if i got to play ben's dad? joey, you look nothing like ben. i look more like him than you do! y'know, i don't really know you well enough for you to do that. so it's down to these two, nancy i know you like this one and i think i agree. rachel, what do you think? well umm, that one is pretty but uh, i just, i just love this fabric sorry. oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then i take credit for them--i'm kidding. she is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. okay, now i'm kidding! oh, what a fun office. i don't know which one, but i do know i need a cigarette. so what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back? rachel? do you smoke? oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke. and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me! that doesn't seem fair. i know! it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit! yeah, it is the best. i mean what if this keeps happening? y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? me or smokey smokerson? rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. just say you wanna get some fresh air. yeah, i can do that. yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke. hey! hey! hey rach, you wanna get some coffee?

is that what you want? ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy emily? the emily that wouldn't let him see you? noo! oh no! no! god no! he should not get back together with her. i know that! you know that! even ross knows that! but that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message! i'm his sister, okay? i love him! i don't want to see him get hurt! come on! doesn't that give me the right to control him- help him? i don't think he's the one who needs help. no, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? i mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. okay, fine! but i mean, look at the position she's putting him in! what's he gonna do? ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! i mean, who would do that?! okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! although it did involve a lot of the same people. ugh! y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him. okay, you are crazy! i'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! i mean, listen! noooooooo! okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? i mean nothing bad can go down! no. but that reminds me, sign this. what is it? oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off. oh, hurry up. i want to sign that. okay, here he comes. what is he doing? what the hell is he doing?! what? what? what? what is it? is everything okay? what's going on? okay, he sees us. now don't move. don't look at him. hey, it's okay. it was just a car backfire. hey, look at that! you tried to save your buddy. you see that?

fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. i just don't want to be a part of it. oh, maybe that's emily calling back to leave the exact same message. hey ross! it's you! i just want you to remember this feeling. you are lucky to be alive! so live everyday to the fullest. love yourself, okay?

and bang! a shot was fired. and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me! my god, joey! it was a car backfire! yeah, but-but he didn't know that! yeah, i didn't know that. and it could've just as easily have been a bullet. hey joe, you ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you. who jumps at loud noises! wow! i could've died tonight. yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think i'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. i do have a newfound respect for life. oh my god! so you wanna get some dinner? yeah! sure! yep! oh, y'know what? if i heard a shot right now, i'd throw my body on you. oh yeah? well maybe you and i should take a walk through a bad neighborhood. okay! all right. bye! cut it out ross! i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day! dude! how come you took off? oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever is something wrong? no. no i'm just tired. y'know, from-from the walk. okay. you dove in front of ross! ross! that's what this is about! oh my god, you hate ross! i do not hate ross! of course you do! i saved him! you're mad at me! it all adds up! you want ross out of the picture. what picture? i don't know, but i don't like what i'm hearing! look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me! ohh, you're upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! iknewyou could take care of yourself. y'know, i mean ross, he need help. he's not street like us! when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that's the bottom line. well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i wasn't trying to save ross. okay? my sandwich was next to ross. all right? i was, i was trying to save my sandwich. from a bullet! i know it doesn't make much sense much sense?! look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it! so you risked your life, for a sandwich! i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world! so you didn't uh, choose ross before me. no! i would never do that! you-you're like my brother! really?! yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here. thanks. no, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog! how good is that? oh-oi-ho, yeah! see? hm-hmm. oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?! i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me. yeah. with a bite! gee-e-e-eez! hey! hi! rach, what uh, what are you doing here? hey! y'know what? you are in our apartment all the time! okay? this is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister! y'know, it-it doesn't matter. the important thing is that you're here. you're my friend, and you're here. oh! okay, just a little scared. what's going on ross? the most amazing thing happened tonight. i thought my number was up. i had an actual near death experience! what?! what? what happened?! okay, okay, we were on the ride along with gary, right? yeah! and somebody took a shot at me! really?! no, a car backfired, but i thought somebody was taking a shot at me. and rach, ii survived! and i was filled with this-this great respect for life. y'know? i-i want to experience every moment. i want to seize every opportunity. i-i am seeing everything so-so clearly now. because a car backfired? okay, why are you here? well, i-i-i don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, emily called you today. you talked to her? no, she left a message. but it-it kinda got erased. there's just something wrong with your machine. well, okay, what-what did she say? well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her. wow! now, that-that was a good thing that i told you, right? huh? yeah! yes, of course! okay. thank you! thank you! because- i'm sorry, all right. because y'know what? she didn't want me- not important. the point is, i was right. your decision. okay? i was right. your decision. right. i guess, i guess i should call emily. okay, no, that's not the right decision. that's not, that's not right, no ross-ross, come on! i mean, that woman made you miserable! okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that? okay, look, yesterday i would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience. i mean, that-that has got to mean something! ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience! you weren't there! okay, maybe this is something that i-i'm supposed to seize! y'know? okay, y'know what? maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. maybe this is about escaping stuff. huh. i mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily? that does make sense. because i do wanna seize some opportunity, but i-i really don't wanna see or talk to her. well, there you go! yeah. maybe today is just, close call day. close call day. hey, thanks rach. ohh, honey no problem. okay. oh wait-wait-wait! the message is blinking. maybe you didn't erase it. oh? ""hey ross, it's you!"" oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that. no. hey umm, was-was monica here? yeah. yeah, i want my money back. yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right? hey pheebs, has gary ever been shot at for real? yes. once. yeah, a little. he kinda did it to himself. it's not really a good story. i wonder how i would react under fire, y'know? and not backfire but-but heavy fire, like i was in a war or something. man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys. before or after you were shot by your own troops? i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us. yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches. yeah, hero sandwiches. well you all know that i'm a pacifist so i'm not interested in war in any way. but y'know what? when the revolution comes, i will have to destroy you all. not you joey."

so, why don't you just take it back to where you got it? i tried! they won't take her back. maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-christ. rach, why won't they take it back? well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. i mean, what am i going to do, get a thousand regular cats? look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it. no mon that's not the point. i'm out a thousand dollars, i'm all scratched up, and i'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! don't-don't throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!! oh god! okay. okay. it's okay. man, that was close. yeah, you almost overreacted to something. hey! we have great news! we're moving in together! isn't it great! yay! congratulations! congrats! i know, i'm so excited! so am i! well, you're not more excited than i am! no way! i'm the most excited! okay, i'll see you at the station later. okay, yeah, i'll see you later! don't forget about the moving in! all right. so you're moving in with him. what happened?

but again, simmons. go on. the strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but i didn't feel anything at all! ooh! so now why can't we tell chandler? because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. i just don't want anything to spoil that. oh, i can't believe you guys lasted a whole year! i know. wow! i owe rachel 20 bucks! what? on a totally different bet. hey! it's almost our anniversary! i know. can you believe it? one year ago today i was just your annoying friend chandler. awww! now you're just my annoying friend chandler. huh. i got you a present! oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow! i know, but you have to open it today! okay. okay! there you go! it's two tickets to vegas! wow! for this weekend! oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. we can call it out plane-aversary. do we have to?

oh no. what richard thing? simmons! go with simmons! okay, i umm, i ran into richard yesterday and he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did. the only reason i didn't tell you is because i knew you'd get mad and i didn't want to spoil our anniversary. i'm not mad. really?! oh yeah! yeah, so you-you bumped into richard! you grabbed a bite! it's no big deal. great! okay, london 1 oh! look what happened! huh, check me out! i'm in my kitchennaked! i'm picking up an orange. i'm naked! lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. oh my god! that's rachel naked! i can't look at that! i am looking at this. okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes- unless she wants me to be looking at that. she knows i'm home. she knows i can see her. what kind of game is she playing?

no more joey and chan's. no more j and c's. ""you wanna go over to joey and chandler's?"" ""can't, its not there."" look, i'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff. yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future. not once did we do that. hi. hey! hi. so i, i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us. oh yeah? well, how'd she take it? really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she didn't cry. she wasn't angry or sad. and you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry? i mean, all i'm asking for is just a little emotion! is that too much to ask after six years?! i mean what? are-are-are rachel and i not as close as you guys?! i mean do we not have as much fun?! don't i deserve a few tears?!! i mean we-we told joey, he cried his eyes out! hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! it's like the end of an era! no more j-man and channie's!! okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that?! you got married again. yes. so that's your second marriage in two years. yes, second in two years. third overall. ross, i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client. why don't you tell me what happened. basically, rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk i'm sorry, is this the same rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage? yes-yes-yes! but, i-i do not love her. oh, that's better then. this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled. i see. have you considered therapy? i think just the annulment for today. there are a couple of forms to fill out. easy. and we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind. no problem. and we'll need you and rachel to testify before a judge. ooh! there's no way to do this without her? 'cause i kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of. of course you did. look ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there. uh-ha, what about someone who looks like rachel? i will think about the therapy. hey! hey. so um, i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff. okay! y'know, no point in dragging it out. dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore. okay. hey rach, what about this? huh? who-who gets this? see, i don't know if i want it because it might be y'know, too many memories! what the hell is that? i don't know. hey, rachel, you want the big plate? i want you to have the big plate. wow! mon, thanks! i love this plate! something to remember me by! mon, honey you're not dying. i'm just moving out. y'know, i mean we're gonna see each other all the time. but still, it's a big change. the end of an era, you might say! are you okay? you're not blinking. i'm fine! i just, i'm thinking how much it's an end of era. oh, all right. but y'know i gotta say, i don't, i don't think six years counts as an era. an era is defined as a significant period of time. now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you! what is the matter with you?! what is the matter with you?!! why aren't you more upset?! aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! i mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?! all right, fine, but don't get mad at me. it's-it's just a little hard to believe. what's hard to believe? well y'know, it's you guys. you-you do this kind of stuff! y'know? i mean, you-you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out! i guess i'm not upset because i don't see you guys going through with it. i'm sorry. rachel, it's going to happen. chandler is gonna move in here. but i no-no, wait! just let me finish, okay? this isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in vegas, this is something we both really want. and it is going to happen. it is? really? yeah, sweetie. i mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore? no. what? oh my god! i'm gonna miss you so much! i'm gonna miss you! i mean it's the end of an era! i know! okay, bye! oh no. so? did you get the annulment? i couldn't. i knew it! because you love rachel. it's not that. okay? annulments are more complicated than i yeah, complicated 'cause of the love. i i do, i do not love rachel. i'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. okay? would i do that if i loved her? i've never been more convinced of your love for her. i do not have feelings for rachel! okay?! ohh, what's wrong?! monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing. oh my- come here! come here! it's okay. everything's gonna be okay. thank you. of course. so, ross and rachel got married, monica and chandler almost got married, do you think you and i should hook up? oh we do, but not just yet. really?! well, when? okay umm, well, first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. yeah. but it won't work out. wow. i know. then, i'm gonna marry chandler for the money and you'll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids. great! but then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. we'll have chandler's money and rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachel's drinking problem. oh-oh, what about ross? i don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and i kill him."

""wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" nice! yeah? i just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? someone i can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. and what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? enh? not just a hat rack my friend! pheebs, i have to ask you shhhhhh! i'm swamped right now. you're just staring into space. umm, i'm trying to move that pencil. this one? it worked! pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. i mean, look at this; ""wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" it's just, there is nothing! the city's full! wait, no, look at this! ""two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, satan worshipers okay"" oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor. hey! hey. rach, uh, you still looking for a place? yeah! why? okay, there's this guy, warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. so uh, you interested?

no. no, i won't. but i should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! and that's how she ended up living with me! okay, that's a lie. hi. hi. hi, listen, i'm sorry about before. i don't need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldn't get girls, and now i can 'em- now, i have you. not-not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women stop it chandler. i'm sorry too. really? yeah! oh yes! ohh. listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together. that's a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room. totally! we don't have to come up with this now. oh good. hey, y'know what? why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room? changes? yeah, i mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. you're-you're-you're gonna bring the barca lounger over here? is that a problem? well, it's a set and they should probably stay together. oh, that's cool. then i'll just bring them both over. see now-now you're taking them away from their home. okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! i'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work! yeah-yeah, y'know what? yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! nothing will be yours! that's-that's what i said! oh come on, chandler! i'm talking about the barca lounger! it just, it doesn't match! where is it gonna go?! in the game room! look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly! all right! that's fine! that's fine! i won't bring over the chairs! i won't bring anything over! i wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place!! everything on your application looks really good- ohh! just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out? oh don't worry, i'm not really a party girl. whoa!! now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay? you can call off the roommate search! hi! i'll be living here. oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i don't think he's gonna get it. why did you take the shower curtain down? that thing was a hazard! i'm very safety conscious. hey! hey! oh listen, i was just clearing some space for your stuff. oh thanks, but listen, i was just at monica's and she and chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in. what do you mean, they're not moving in? they-they're still moving in right? no-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room. what?! over a stupid room! yeah, i feel kinda bad for them, but i'm also really psyched 'cause i don't have to move in here! oh no, yeah no, that part's great! what's all this about you guys fighting?! is this really over a room?! i mean, that is so silly! ross, we can handle this. well, apparently not, and i can't just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness! well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly! okay-okay! two very good points, look i've known you both a long time, and i've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly. now wh-what is more important, love or silliness? well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love. love is the best medicine. that's laughter. why do you do it? i don't know. okay! all right! now, chandler you-you wanna live with monica, right? yeah, i do. and mon, you wanna live with chandler, don't ya? yes. good! a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york! so i understand you're looking for a place. no-no, i'm staying put. oh, i was going to offer you my apartment. why, where are you going? i don't know. hey rach! hi! you're never gonna believe it uh, monica and chandler are moving in again. that's great news right- i mean for them. right? oh wow. yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again. yeah. y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird? wh-why?! why-why-why would it, why would it be weird? well, because of us! because of our history. no! no? no! no! it would be weird if we were still in that place, i mean are you still in that place? no! not at all! good! me neither! so it's not a problem. we're just two friends who happen to be roommates. okay, but ross, eventually you and i are gonna be dating. really?! we are? yeah! i'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend ohh! that would be great. but y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. y'know, it'll be like college, i'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""come back later, i'm gettin' lucky."" yeah, i didn't think of that. so are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! i mean it's a really big step! and-and what's the rush?! that's very funny! he's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness! no, i-i-i'm serious, okay? i mean, think about it. you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up! ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room. okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isn't about the room, this is about what the roomrepresents! and unfortunately, this room could destroy you!! yeah, i'm not so worried. yeah, no, me neither. fine! it's your life! i just don't want to see you guys break up! which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing i can do. don't do it!!!!! you still want to move in together right? of course! ross didn't scare you? scared me out of ever wanting to live with him. come here, i want to show you something! okay! oh my god! someone's killed square man! this is where i thought the barca lounger could go! you see you could see the tv and it's still walking distance to the kitchen. oh that's so sweet! i want to show you something too! okay! y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""merge?"" uh-hmm. y'know? so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. because, that's you and i together! merge! oh my god! i love that! really?! uh, no!! i found you in my bed! how'd you whined up there? you are a mystery! little black curly hair! little black curly hair! little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so i can buy a computer. so umm, where are the other guys?

sure! here. thank you. now are you sure? because once i make a copy, there's no turning back. yeah, i'm-i'm sure. yeah, get out of here before i change my mind. umm, listen, ross do you really think this moving in with rachel is a good idea? i've been back and forth. yeah well, maybe you should go back! okay? rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! back together! ehh, i don't, i don't think so. she's already talked about y'know, dating other guys. that's not gonna work out! then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, ""oh that's okay. you'll find someone."" and then, bamn! she finds you! yeah, well, m-maybe you're right. i am telling you ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! now, is that what you want?

oh right, coach ruben. do you know what pheebs? when you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. see that's where i think that you're wrong. we've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense. what do you mean? i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and y'know mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping. okay, i'm a rookie. i should not be in the end zone. this is so great! this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant. yeah? well this is not what i ordered. hey guys! hey! hey! hey babies! oh, i'm having the best morning. that uh, that porsche i've got the keys too, still there! shocking! since you still have the keys. you should see the treatment i get when i'm with that car! people are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! one guy gave me advice about my equity investments. what equity investments? the ones that got me the porsche! will you keep up! but i figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that i don't own it. so i figured i'll wash it. right? monica, you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow? oh yeah, i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound. you don't even have a car! i know. but umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so i washed it. and? and six others. there you are. yeah, she tops out at 130. wow! and that's just in the city. i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate. really! you got a place upstate? sure! well, i'll see you later. okay, take it easy. hey! that's my car. really? oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it. what-what are you doing? oh i-i uh, found the keys and now i'm just polishing her up. but it's my car! yeah, but it's my wax. listen, i-i-i don't come to this city much so i don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could i have my keys. sure. here. i'll uh, save your parking spot. i'm not coming back. why not? i live upstate. yeah, so did i. i don't know why i was so nervous about this. and i don't know why frank and alice are always complaining. this is so easy. yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same. check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, they can meet krog! chandler, what are you doing? that thing can put someone's eye out! he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe! no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up. they're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass! what?! glass, sand, whatever. oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep. oh it's so cute. i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head. oh, i can still do that. how are you still single?! all right. i thought about it and maybe you're right. maybe krog is not a safe toy. good. what made you change your mind? i swallowed the sonic blaster gun. how did that happen?!! well, i was trying to prove that i was right. y'know? and it turns out i was wrong. and now it's lodged in my throat. damnit! y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching chandler! okay you two are asking the court for an annulment? yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out. so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr. geller is mentally unstable. fine, i'm mentally unstable. and based on the fact that mr. geller is intravenous drug user. what?! uh yes, heroin and crack. crack isn't even an intravenous drug! well, you would know. now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage? oh, come on! ross, please, i found the magazines! and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin. okay, i'm sorry, this is insane! i-i-i'm not addicted to heroin, i'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! look, i'll consummate this marriage right here, right now! that won't be necessary. and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies! ugh! now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem. ross! your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! and could you strike ""consummated like bunnies"" from the record? is there, anything in this record that is actually true? well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think. well, based on what i heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. if you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce. that's great! are you happy now? look what you did with your funny, funny form! what?! me?! what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense! and what- - what are you typing that for? did you hear what she said? we don't get the annulment. don't type that! what?! stop typing! hey! stop typing! stop typing! stop typing!! okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?! you need to get out of my chambers. all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one! yeah! would you like to spend the night in jail? and thank you for your time. so the porsche guy took his car back. but you found the keys to his clothes? no. no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche. and people will think you own a porsche because you're wearing the clothes? of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! right? that is true. yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun. oh, i've been there. yeah, i am gonna go drive my porsche. joey, you know you don't actually have one. come on! what are you doing?! i'm in character! would you talk to her! ahh, i think it just moved. it's really poking me. all right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room. what?! no, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! we're baby-sitting! the babies are asleep, i'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while! but you-you can't leave me with them! we-we're a team! we're playing a zone! they're gonna triple team me! he's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital. but no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years. i think that's gum. i'm pretty sure it's gun. okay, listen this really hurts. let's go. a real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! no! what would, what would krog do? why isn't that valet back with my porsche? maybe because you've got the keys? porsche. this is totally your fault! my fault?! you threatened the judge! well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!! that was the only way i could get him to stop typing! hi! how are the gellers? don't call us that! the judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! now we gotta get a divorce!! did a porsch throw up on you? hey! it's porsche!! me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? okay, i'm gonna take that spit bubble as, ""yeah, i do!"" okay, after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, i'll set you up with a clean one. okay, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to scare you. i just have to clean that up. okay? 'cause let's face it, we're at monica's. i broke it. all right. well, that's just the way that goes. okay, good. why are there only two of you? where is leslie? well, you can't answer. leslie? where are you leslie? leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! well, look at you! hey! you are a little bit mischievous! my gosh! oh, you're a lot mischievous! well, it'll dry. okay, you sit with your brother and sister now- who aren't there! hey! how do you feel? well, let's just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed. and protected them from a tornado? oh my god. i know, the babies are asleep. phoebe, what, what happened here?! i did it! i took care of the babies all by myself! but my apartment! was the setting of phoebe's triumph. but the mess! is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. you're right, you're right i shouldn't freak out. 'cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies! when will that be?! phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! oh honey thank god you're home, i was getting worried. i picked up the divorce papers. uh, i've already signed everything and i put little 'x's where you need to sign. oh, little 'x's! great! that makes up for everything! y'know, i-i- you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! okay? oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one! okay, how about you flew to london to stop my wedding! ah, how about you told me you loved me after i was already married! hey! wait a minute! that was different! i did those things because i was in love with you! yeah! right! you're right. that's very different. so let's, let's just sign the papers. all right? what? nothing. okay, can we just sign please? uh-hmm. congratulations. okay ross, we're- wait a minute. umm, i uh, i kinda have a little confession. what? well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea. excuse me? well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married? yeah? and uh, yeah, i didn't really, i didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. and uh, and i thought it would be funnier if we got married. so as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. so umm, sorry i got us into this mess. so then if-if- i mean if you think about it, this is all your fault. yeah, don't push it though. i've got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women, never thought i would be divorcing you. i know. i always thought if you and i got married, it would be the one that stuck. and it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at pizza hut. did i, did i even treat? no, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special. that may be the most depressing thing i've heard in my life. i should probably get these to my lawyer's office. hey, thanks ross, for taking care of all of this. eh, no problem. i'm gonna need a copy of those. totally. hey! hey! be careful around my porsche! hi joey. hey! how you doin'? he has the most amazing porsche under there! i'd love to show ya, but i just tucked her in. she's sleeping. hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?"

i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? but i have to trick him into taking it so i won't hurt his pride. why don't you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. whatever you want. well that would help the pride thing. hey! hey! wow! you look great! wanna move in with me tomorrow?

y'know? does rachel move the phone pen? aw, sometimes. always, actually. okay, good. there you go. doesn't anyone feel better? not just the phone pen. i never get my messages. you get your messages! yeah, well i don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch. so-so, you missed a message from who? chandler or your mom? or chandler? or your mom? great! it worked! no one's sad. yes! i win again! ha-ha! that's like 500 bucks you owe me! whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! whoo-ho-ho! i gotta buy some food. okay, give me a chance to win my money back. okay? sudden death, one goal, $1,000. you serious? oh yes! okay, get ready to owe me! okay. okay, here we go. ready? no! no! no! no- - one can beat me. see? now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. hello?

you know what else i'm not gonna miss? ""i'm monica. i wash the toilet 17 times a day. even if people are on it!"" ""hi i'm rachel, is my sweater too tight? no? oh, i'd better wash it and shrink it!"" ""i'm monica, i don't get phone messages from interesting people. ever!"" hey! i call her! ""oh my god, i love ross! i hate ross! i love ross! i hate ross!"" ""oh my god, i can't find a boyfriend! so i guess i'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy i find in there!"" yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. still broken? this sucks man! the last night you're here and i lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500. well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little blackjack? nah, not my game. okay, uh, how about, how about- y'know what? we could play a new game. a new game, it's fun. well, what's it called? cups. i don't know how to play cups. i'll teach ya! come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun. all right. okay, here you go. i have two queens, what do you have? a two and a five. ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars! really?! oh yeah! okay, let's play again. what do you got? a four and a nine. you're kidding right? no. why? well that's a full cup! damn! i am good at cups! i'm not talking to her! well, one of you has to take the first step! and it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. it's harder for her! well, maybe you're right- she made fun of my phone pen! i know, i took it hard too. listen rachel, i feel really bad about- what are you doing? i'm unpacking! what?! i'm not moving! is that picture straight? it needs to go about 20 blocks to the left! hey, y'know what? you're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with chandler! you should be the one to go! why should i have to leave?! because it's my apartment! well it's mine too! what else you got?! how about, you're moving!! look! this is ridiculous. we should be packing you!! hey, how are you guys doing? great! monica's moving! i am not! oh really?! then how come all your stuff is in this box?! okay, you guys. you guys i think i know what's going on here. okay, you guys stop!! i know that, i know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. but deep down you're still really sad. deep-deep down. no phoebe i am mad! well, deep-deep-deep down! yeah, i'm just mad! then keep running. you win. well, what did you have? it doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. that my friend is d-cup. okay, now much have you won so far? uh, wow, 700. not 700 exactly? yeah. double it! what? well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. really? hey, i didn't make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get- no way! well, this is the last box of your clothes. i'm just gonna label it, ""what were you thinking?"" funny, because i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler. hey you guys, i don't mean to make things worse, but umm, i don't want to live with rachel anymore. you're just so mean to each other! and i don't want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you! well, phoebe that's fine because i'm not moving. whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you gotta take her! y'know i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. oh really? like what monica? y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots oh yeah, good start mon. she lets you borrow them. yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet. do you wanna live outside?! because it's gettin' cold! she gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that i'd like. what else? when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. yeah, i do. i-i do, do that. that's nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom. when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. well y'know, i don't want you to be cold. and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive. you were so great. you made it so easy. and now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!! oh, it's gonna be fine. okay rachel, i can't wait to live with you! and you know what we should do? bring monica and then we could all live there together! we'll have so much fun!! but honey, i think she's moving in with chandler. oh that's right. you're still set on that? kinda. oh my god! hello? hey mon, how's the packing going? ben? he's fine. yeah, he's right- oh my god! get your head of your shirt there son! what? yeah, it's a pumpkin. i'll come pack. hey! what's wrong? ross and i were helping the girls pack, took a little break, i lost $1,500 to him in cups! wh-how did you lose at cups?! the same way you lost. i started out with a king and a queen, bamn! ross gets a 2 and a 3. then i get a jack and a king, boom! ross gets a 4 and a 5! ross was getting the cup card, the d-cup, the sittin' down bonus! meanwhile, i didn't even get half a cup! nothin'!! oh man!! and he never played before either! y'know what i think? i think beginner's luck, very important in cups. all right, let's play one more hand! one more! no, no, no more! i cannot lose another dime! i'm serious this time! in-in fact, look, there's a- i wanna give you something. and let me give it too you know before i pawn it for cups money. now, i want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate. i can't take the big white dog! you love it! it's him, not it! no, but wait- what if i bought it from you, y'know? and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500? wait a second, i see what you're trying to do here! you-you're trying to give me money again! when did i try to give you money? over there! before, with the bills! you tried to give some charity, i said ""no,"" you dropped it. okay? then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! i'm just trying to help you out! okay? i wanna make sure that you're okay. i will be okay! look chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that i can't take care of myself. okay? look, i'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. the only thing that i'm gonna missis you. and now the dog. hey. call me when you get there. okay?

well, y'know, the reason i didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little... so? well, it's embarrassing. people were looking at us like we were crazy. why do you care? because they're people. but people that you don't know and will never see again. yes, but still. they're peoplewith eyes. well, i didn't get embarrassed running next to miss . but no, okay. no, no, i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. yeah, okay. you're uptight. i-i am not uptight- hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! listen, i am not uptight, man. that's okay rachel. i'm not judging you; that's just who you are. me. i'm more free y'know? i run like i did when i was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. y'know, i mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan? the neighbor's dog. okay, is this lamp in the same place? who cares? i repel women. no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! you can't come in here! r-r-r-r-ross is naked. what?! what?! i couldn't say that i was naked because she's allowed too see me naked. why does anyone have to be naked? why is ross naked? i-i had to show chandler something? naked? yeah-yeah i uh, i have a uh, a guy problem. is it the same thing that chandler had? look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later. okay, listen, there's still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. bye! bye! thank god dude, what'd you have? look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we gotta get everything back into its original place. the photo album! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. we just go through it and match everything to the pictures. that's perfect! that's brilliant! so really, what'd ya have? hey joey, i got some beer for you. uh, don't you mean ""for whom?"" sure, listen i was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one? pizza, heh, its not like i never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh. is there something wrong? all right, all right, let's just get this out in the open okay? you're hot. i'm lovable. clearly there's a vibe going on between us. but, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road. joey... no, no, no, i'm telling ya. imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? so the question is, what do we do? well, i don't think there is anything to do. i mean i think you're really sweet, but i'm just not interested in you like that. oh! no! i mean you're a really nice guy and i'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, i'm just y'know, i just don't feel that way about you. oh! i see what happened. it's because i was trying to repel you. right? believe me, you'd feel a lot different if i turned it on. i don't think so. oh, i do. how you doin? i'm ok what?!?! what? oh dear god! hey! hey! oh honey, i'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great! see? and you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone! gone! i mean its amazing pheebs. i feel so free and so graceful. hey! look out for the horse! sorry! is it okay for me to come in now? uh-huh why is everything different? bye! no, i don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets. okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, i-i-i cleaned the apartment. so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it, where it went back and i'm sorry, i'm very sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. it's okay. chandler, are you afraid of me or something? do you want me to be afraid of you? of course not. i mean gosh, chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it. i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place, but i'd never expect you to worry about that. really? of course! oh well you're the best. you come here to me. all right, hold on okay? first thing's first. okay, now did ross sit anywhere while he was naked? so it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. so theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer... ...and live forever as a machine! that's so janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? you and i, we're interfacing. yeah, i gotta go. ba dum bumb cheshhh!"

look, i know that i should've told them. i know i shouldn't care what they think. i'm sorry. y'know, it'll be okay. it'll be okay. because when they come over, i will be all charming, i will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em. you really think that'll work?

the beef? yeah, that was weird to me, too. but then, y'know, i thought 'well, there's mincemeat pie,' i mean that's an english dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. oh! by the way, can i borrow some rum from your place? y-sure! and while i'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste. okay. beef in a dessert?! i- no no no, there is no way! i know, and only one layer of jam?! what is up with that? oh my god, the pages are stuck together! chandler! oh my god, she-she made half a english trifle, and half a...sheperd's pie! oh man! now she's gonna start all over! we're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world! no, no, we will. we just won't tell her she messed up. just let her serve the beef-custard thing?

i don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, i'm i'm sorry. i-i didn't think it would matter. how could it not matter?! how was i supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister? what about all that 'friends forever' stuff? i don't know, i-i was all high. mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get ross stoned! your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me! ross, i can't believe you'd do that! the reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this? okay, okay, i'll tell 'em it wasn't chandler who got high. now who should i say it was? you! it's not like it's a big deal! you-you don't still do it or anything! alright, alright, now-now who should i say tricked me into doing it?

yeah, i'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore. rachel, there you are! come on, let's serve that dessert already! joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? you don't get any dessert. really? no, i'm just kidding i would never do that to you! okay, everybody, it's trifle time! so, now, rach, this is a traditional english trifle, isn't it? it sure is. wow. so then did you make it with beef or eggplant? beef. i can't have any. you know i don't eat meat. ohhh no. alright, monica, i want you to have the first taste. really? oh oh oh, wait! you only got whipped cream in there! ya gotta take a bite with all the layers! okay. op! wait, you dropped a pea. well? mmmm! it's good! really? how good? it's so good, that i feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is. especially ross. mmm. yeah, this is so good, that i'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert. i've gotta call my friend mary and tell her how good this is, from monica's room. i'll help you dial. i'm gonna go into the bathroom so i can look at it in the mirror, as i eat it. okay, now what was that all about? is it-does it not taste good? let me try it. wha? no no! ah! all gone! so good! maybe chandler has some left. it tastes like feet! i like it. are you kidding? what's not to like? custard? good. jam? good. meat? gooooood. ...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street? yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it. rachel, come here. okay, i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap, and i had another dream about jack. oh, phoebe, do i wanna hear this? i dunno, let's see! so, okay, i dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. and, um, so okay, i went to a night club, and i saw him making out with a girl. oh my god, he dream-cheated on you! yeah, but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! it was soo cool! then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen. boy, i'm glad i wore the big belt today. five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. now nothing. well, not nothing, i am still a woman. ross? let's go. oh yeah, about telling mom and dad, i was thinking about maybe writing a letter. alright, you know what? that's it. you've had your chance. wha-what? mom! dad! ross smoked pot in college! what?! you are such a tattletale! mom, dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?

6.0,10.0,The Routine,"let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? i remember when people used to use big lights. that's a good story, grandpa. hey hey wow, monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! did someone get her drunk again or? having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about. it's about being with the people that you love. that is nice and we're done. tada! i dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like christmas to me. oh, here. see now it feels like christmas! and that's the story of the dreidle. now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. and that was like 4000 years ago. so, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story. hey you guys. hey joe what's up? i had to get out of the apartment. janine is like stretching all over the place. y'know, everywhere i look she's like i can see why that's hard to resist. i like her so much! aw, i'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way. i know. and she's so sweet. i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair. you are aware that she's not a monkey, right? i am so over janine. i mean, yeah, at first i thought she was hot, but now she's like old news! hey guys! hi janine! i just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for new year's eve. it's called some sort of dick'n rock'n dickie eve. hold it! are you talking about dick clark's new year's rocking eve? yeah, that's what i said. oh my god! we love that show! i mean ross and i have been watching it since i can remember! ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you? well i'm gonna be on it this year. i'm gonna be one of the party people. you're gonna be a party person! those guys rock the most! well they said i should bring someone. do you wanna be my dance partner? totally! i would love to spend new year's with you. well actually they're taping tomorrow. i don't really understand why. oh, well you see how it works is, the part with dick clark in times square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. yeah, not a lot of people know that. yeah well, do you guys wanna come too? are you serious? we are there! what, what are you laughing at? well, i used to date him, but you're still going out with her! thanks. great so we can all go together! i gotta run. catch you later! bye! bye janine! did she just ask me out on a date? i don't think so. what are you talking about? she just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium! yeah, but she also invited you and ross. yeah, honey, i'm sorry, but i don't think that was a romantic thing. oh. maybe. but hey i know how i can find out. we're going to a new year's eve party, right? so at midnight, i can kiss her. and if she kisses me back, great! y'know? but if she says 'dude, what the hell are you doing?' i can say 'it wasn't me, it was new years!' well, that's a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick. it was a dry day. we are going to dick clark's new year's rocking eve! oh my god! oh my god! oh my god! ok, listen i've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? it's a show, but we're just dancing, ok? it's no big deal. the important thing to remember - stay cool. got it! oh my god it's just like i dreamed it! ok, everyone gather up.

yeah. you don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything? no, we never do that because that's where joey gave me some stuff to store that i've never seen before in my life! okay, that did not just happen! okay, here comes another camera. right. no biggie. stay loose. why do they keep doing that? if we wanna get on camera, i think we have to get up on one of those platforms. they've been taping those people up there all day. right. hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there? we learned how to dance. oh yeah?

the routine! ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school. hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform! was it really that good? we got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice? okay, let's do it. mom and dad are gonna be so faced! 5 6 7 8! so, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next? oh no! you get up there and do that again exactly like that! yes! make sure you get this, they're gonna want it for the bloopers show. alright cut! listen up everyone, when we start again it's gonna be the countdown to new years, so i wanna see everybody's excitement. hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner. what's going on over here? uh, take a look at the guy's pants! i mean, i know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard? what's the matter with you? get out of here! yeah, take a hike wetpants! can you believe this? we're gonna be on the platform for the millennium moment! i know! hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you? no! me too! hey, when the music starts up again, i was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?

no! didn't think so! okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are! oh, the duck seems to think that monica got me garbage! hmm, i wonder what i could get monica that's as good as garbage? hmm, how about my azzz? hey, this is hollow. what? this bench, it's hollow! i can't believe i never knew that! oh, the presents!!! no, don't look directly at them! what? alright, no, we could look at them! oh, this one's for me! oh, this one's for chandler. here. oh great! and the big one's for me! ooh, let's open them! okay! okay! okay! hee hee! wait, we can't do this. why? i don't wanna know what monica got me. y'know? i mean, look, i'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and i, look we have to put these back, this is not what christmas is about. whatever linus, i'm opening mine. nobody is opening anything ok? look, i don't know about you guys, but i wanna see the look on monica's face when i give her my present, and i'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when i get mine. so please, please, can we just, can we put them back?

we are looking at a playboy. oh, i want to look too! . yikes! so do you think that these pictures- are, are they trying to tell a story? oh, yeah, sure. i mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'where are they, where are they?' well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that. oh, yeah. aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over? you see, now, i would date this girl. she's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. i mean, that's got to come in handy okay, i've got a question. if you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be? i don't know. me neither. rachel. what?! i don't know. me neither. you forget how many great songs heart had. yeah. you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard. so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it. oh, you guys, with this joke. i gotta say, i know i cracked up, but i'm not even sure i got it. what, you didn't get it? the doctor is a monkey. and monkeys can't write out prescriptions. you are not allowed to laugh at my joke. your joke? well, i think 'the hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars. so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money. well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think i'll show the sexy teller that i am a published writer. well, she is going to know that you stole the joke. oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there? yeah! well, i'm not going to go now anyway . okay . here you go. ah, gunther, i can't pay for this right now because i'm not working, so i've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff. well, if you want, you can work here. uh, i don't know. ya see, it's just, see i was a regular on a soap opera y'know? and to go from that to this, i just plus, i'd have to wait on all my friends. okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want. what?! flexible hours. maybe i could be a waiter. could i use the phone? she picked rachel. i mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. she picked rachel. he took my joke, he took it. it's wrong. you know what else is wrong? phoebe picking rachel. you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? he stole my joke. you know what? i'm going to get a joke journal. y'know? and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes. that's a good idea. yeah! do you know what's a bad idea? picking rachel. that's right. did you hear something? maybe it's the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts. it's coming from the living room. i finished my book. hey, you guys. oh, don't you guys look cute. you guys make such a cute couple. monica, what are you doing? nothing, i'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. remember, when you picked rachel over me? that was funny. i guess it was kinda funny. it wasn't funny at all! why would you do that? why didn't you pick me? fine. the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that you're just kinda high maintenance- okay let's go to lunch! that is completely untrue. you think i'm high maintenance? okay, prove it. i want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point! no, okay, you're right. you're easy-going. you're just not as easy-going as rachel. she's just more flexible and-and mellow. that's all. well, people are different. ya, you know, rachel she'll do whatever you want. y'know, you can just walk all over her. what? wait a minute. what are you saying, that i'm a pushover? i'm not a pushover. oh, okay, you're not a pushover. oh my you think i'm a pushover. well wait, watch this, you know what? you're not invited to lunch. what do you think of that?

'i'm sorry, that seat's saved.' that's the whole part? okay, i'll see you in an hour. oh, man, i could totally get that part. 'i'm sorry, that seat is taken.' oh, excuse me. no, no, i didn't mean you. but, you believed me, huh? i believed you were saving this seat for someone. so, you'd hire me, right? for what? exactly! all right, everybody, listen up. the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour. huh? what? yeah, it's for the kids. to keep the kids off drugs. it's a very important issue in this month's playboy. i'm sure you all read about it. it's my joke. it's my joke. y'know, i don't think we're going to settle this. let's have monica decide. yeah! yeah! hey mon. mon, get out here! monica! okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is. why do i have to decide? because you're the only one that can be fair. yeah. i can't be fair. you're my boyfriend. yeah, but i'm your brother. we're family. that's the most important thing in the world. don't try to sway her. i'm your only chance to have a baby. okay, let's go. we'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth- me. okay, chandler, you go first. okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve. oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas? can i finish my story?! do you want me to pick you?! see, i would never snap at you like that. continue. so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steve's doctor's name is doctor muppy. so i said, 'doctor monkey?' and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. are you kidding? okay, look. i-i studied evolution. remember, evolution? monkey into man? plus, i'm a doctor, and i had a monkey. i'm doctor monkey! i'm not arguing with that. all right, i've heard enough. i've made my decision. you are both idiots. the joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! you shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! now let it go! the joke sucks! it's your joke. is not. hi, chandler. there you are. hi, oh hi. hey, it's phoebe and rachel. um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance? monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and- - generosity of spirit. wow, you know what? that is the best fake speech i think i've ever heard. really? i've heard better. wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler. i'm out of words. should i just say the whole thing again? look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler! you're a little high maintenance. ahhh! you are on my list. i'm sorry. you're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that i'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. and that's good too. so, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because i like maintaining you. i didn't even tell him to say that. . all right you're off my list. i'm off the list. phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend. y'know, suddenly i find you very attractive. hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go? not good, no. i didn't get the part, and i lost my job here, so wow! that is a bad audition. how-how did you lose your job here? well, i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. so, i went anyway, and then he fired me. he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? that's not, that's not right. yeah, what are ya gonna do? joey, you can't let him get away with that. ya know what, i'm not going to let him get away with that. i'm going to say something to him- no, i really shouldn't say anything- no, i should say something to him. gunther, i want you to give joey his job back. that is really not fair that you have to fire him okay. what? he can have his job back. that's right, he can have his job back. i'm glad we got that all straightened out. there you go, joey, you got your job back. that's great. thanks rach. yeah, pretty nice, huh? now who's a pushover? rach, you're in my seat. oh, i'm sorry. hey, i never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend. i pick you, phoebe. oh, yeah. definitely you, pheebs. yeah, well, i kinda thought. hey. hey. oh, i have a question. if-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick? no way. i'm not answering that. joey! no way. i'm not answering that."

i don't want to talk about it. okay, umm but you know what might really cheer me up? what? seeing some more of your super-cool slides. wow! really?! totally, i love them! and, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand. well, i'd love to! here, you wait right here and i'll go get the projector and my notes! oh great! thanks ross, you're such a good friend! ohh! hey! have you guys seen jill?

barry and mindy are getting a divorce! oh my god! wow! what is the matter with you?! no! barry and mindy. oh sorry, i hear divorce i immediately go to ross. who-who's barry and mindy? barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend. ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her? yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me. why did they get divorced? well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. isn't that sad? god, could you imagine if i actually married him?! i mean how different would my life be? i know what you mean, i've always wondered how different my life would be if-if i'd never gotten divorced. which time? the first time! no seriously, imagine if carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian. i can't. i keep seeing it the good way. i'd bet i'd still be doing my kara-tay. towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical. maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay. and what if i was still fat? well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure. sure i would! oh yeah! come on! yeah right! what, you guys really think that i'm that shallow? no, i just think monica was that fat. hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives! oh-hey, there's carol again! what if i had had the guts to quit my job?

yeah, i had a massage client who worked there and-and he said i had a knack for stocks. well why didn't you take the job? because at that time you see, i thought everything that rhymed was true. so i thought y'know that if i'd work with stocks, i'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox. hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out? oh my god! rachel green? rob tillman! no-no. it's-it's me, ross! oh, i'm sorry. ross tillman. no, no-no, ross geller. ohh, of course monica's brother! yeah. right. wow! how are you?! good-good, i'm-i'm married. ohh! me too! is-isn't it the best?

hey man, look sorry about that archie thing. do uh, do you need me to give you some money? hey, i may have no money, but i still have my pride. really? ehh. maybe joey doesn't have to give you the money, tv stars have assistants right? that's an idea! hey, if i hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her? no joey! chandler could be your assistant! see, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff! that's great! that would be great! let's do that! i could use the money; it could give me time to write. oh right great! welcome aboard! okay! all right! now hey, i need to use the bathroom. since i don't need any assistance in there, take a break! all right! hey! hey phoebe! guess what?

no, there were two. including me? oh yeah.  it only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see one of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye and that is just what i will do, soon as those bastards i work for die! la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la end"

well y'know joey, you're a pretty charming guy. thanks, but i kinda have a problem to deal with here. no sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls c.h.e.e.s.e.! you've got to kiss some serious robot ass! that's not a bad idea. yeah. okay, but if i got to turn on the charm tomorrow i'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. well, actually i got a little bit saved for you pheebs. so do you think uh, joey's more charming than me? yeah! that's why i'm sleeping with him on the side. yeah, you wish. ""you wish."" phoebe, stop writing about us! i'm not writing about you! i'm writing about other people. who? marcia and chester. okay fine! fine! then you know what, i'll just write about phyllis! hmm! hmm. phyllis is sitting in a chair. oh. i see what you're doing! phyllis sees what i'm doing. oh-oh. ooh, i have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter! morning! hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! don't touch him! okay! all right. umm, all right wayne, level with me. okay?

here you go! okay? stupid! i can't believe it! god! hey, how you doin'? so it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so ross selflessly, offered to take me. what a nice story! so ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom. wow! i definitely did not see that one backfiring! i'm gonna go to the bathroom. yeah, take your time. just-just so you know i was a freshman and she was a senior. so it wasn't as bad as-as ross, look, i know i've been giving you a lot of jabs and it's partly because i'm very protective of lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. but i have to admit that after all the wonderful things that lizzie has told me and the many, many, many stories that rachel has told me that, well you're not all bad. not all bad. and anyhow, i'm sorry i was so harsh before, but you have to understand that i still look at lizzie like she's a twelve-year-old girl. yeah. you know what? i know what you mean; i do that too. i beg your pardon? no! no! not- i don't mean i-i see her as a twelve-year-old girl! i mean i-i have a son, who's umm six and i still think of him as a baby. you have a son? yeah, well my-my ex-wife and i share custody of ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, carol and i are on excellent terms as i'm sure you are with your wife! oh, i'm sorry! it's unbelievable! don't worry about it, i just didn't realize you were married. oh we were, but that was just a , i mean that was just a big drunken mistake. you're back. you two were married?! oh! whoops! i'm sorry, you were talking about emily! chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six. we said seven! we said six! the only way that i said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six. yeah and if i had seven, maybe i would've said something like this, ""wow! my boyfriend's such a wise ass- seven!"" hi! oh my good god. ugh! i know what time you said. what?! well actually, i know what time chester and marcia said. what time? quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? ooh, very interesting. yeah, well this certainly clears things up. what does it say?! i will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book. thank you for writing your book. its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything. thanks! so are you. i told you i should not wear this color. mon marcia and chester are planning on seeing a movie on sunday night. marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, chester thinks it's at seven. so you knew we were gonna miss the movie! that's right. inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book! marcia and chester are mad at phyllis. i can't believe i'm going to lose this job! oh i'm so sorry man! is there anything i can do? yeah! help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard. hey joey, i want to talk to you. yeah? well, i don't want to talk to you wayne! i hate you! you ruined my life! oh, chandler, wayne. wayne, chandler. hi, how are ya?

it's pretty much something you're born with if you- - you-you can teach it! i'll show you right how to do it. i mean if you think about it, i mean ross did learn something from each marriage. how to make the next one even shorter? now wait a minute that's not fair. he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily, he just didn't tell me. maybe i have to pee again. well, this is fun. so ross, did you kill any of these wives? y'know what? i-i-i i-i have had enough of this! y'know, i-i-i care a great deal about your daughter and i have treated her with nothing but respect! so if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly are you yelling at me?! god no! y'know what daddy? if you don't like ross, that's fine. it doesn't matter to me, i'm gonna go out with him anyway. really?! well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! still not yelling! wow. what can i say? this doesn't make me like you any better! that's okay, i'm not so crazy about myself right now either. then we agree? uh yeah, i guess- yeah! i guess so. neither of us like ross! i like ross. ohhh! kids! wait-wait-wait, i just thought of another story about how nice ross is! that's okay rach, we're not liking ross right now. oh! i've got a lot of those too! well, it turns out you were right c.h.e.e.s.e. the shipment never made it through omaha?

ugh! well, just buy the damn boat! phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink? i'm just helping the kids! how is you drinking helping the kids? because the more i drink, the less there is for the kids to drink. mr. tribbiani. oh hi! your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center. just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth? i think it was valued at 19,000 hey, i was pretty close. uhh, so bad news. umm, i can't buy the boat, i don't have any money. joey! joey, good one! that's good. very good! so uh listen, i think i'm gonna take off now. hey! youcan'tleave joey! you agreed to buy that boat, all right?! that is a contract! and plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me! well, what am i gonna do rach?! i don't have that kind of money! i know. okay. okay. okay. all right. all right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference. okay. okay. look, i don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! y'know? they should just watch tv after school like i did and i turned out fine! not great. and so, we're hiding in the bathroom. and-and then i sneak out and before monica can her parents come in. so i hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor. oh my god! for further reading on the above story, please check out the one where joey moves out.} i got a good one, i got a good one! i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy. it's so great seeing you guys again. i'd like to make a toast. uh, as a poet once said, ""in the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."" ohh. what?! oh my god, you guys!! before you say anything, have we got a story for you! guess who we bumped into at dinner! who? richard! what? a-ohh! ohh. oh that's right that's right. that's richard's favorite place too. oh you knew that. good! i thought you were going out with elizabeth. yeah, i was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight. oh ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of! y'know, maybe she is too young for me. y'know, when i was over there and she was running around with her friends, i felt like i was a baby-sitter. i finally started to see what you guys were talking about. i don't know what to do. why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. i mean that's what i did when i first weighing stuff. okay umm, bad stuff. well, i'm-i'm 12 years older than she is. if the school finds out you're fired. hmm. she's leaving for three months. for camp! okay, good stuff. umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and look ross, the only question you need to ask is, ""do you see a future?"" i mean like do you see yourself marrying her? oh my god! you did it already! you married her, didn't you?! no! no! ididn't do that. it's just okay, honestly no. i don't, i don't see a big future with her. okay well i thinkthat's your answer. i've got to talk to her. ugh, i hate this part. hey, you have to forget about elizabeth. i mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year! rach! rachel! okay, the next highest bidder is at table one. oh great! oh and uh the guy who got the paris trip is at table four. oh, okay. why do you care about the guy who won the paris trip?

i want that! but joey you don't have $20,000! who cares?! i-i'll make payments, whatever it takes, i want the mr. bowmont!! oh my god, you're back! ohh, let me see it! let me see your hand! why do you want to see my hand? i wanna see what's in your hand. i wanna see the trash. yeah. eww! oh, it's all dirty. you should throw this out. okay. what did you guys just do?! what happened? richard was there so i couldn't do it! what?! noooo i'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it! we didn't ruin it! who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?! well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor glove salesman! good one! yeah. this is terrible. what am i going to do? look, she only suspects something okay? she doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track. that's right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind. yeah! yeah! convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! convince her that you're a little coward! i can do that, i've had 30 years of practice. hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes! that guy's still doing that?! hey! oh my god you're here, let me see your hand!! no, you're too late!!! she already took out the trash!!! wow! i have never had such a healthy break-up! she was such a grown-up about it! she didn't seem too immature for me! did i just make a huge mistake? ross! wait! elizabeth, thank god! i was just thinking about you suck!! what?! okay, break-up's still on! okay, okay, here she comes! how do i look? do i look like a guy who doesn't want to get married? yeah! and also, a little like a french guy. i never noticed that before. hi guys! hey! hey! what are you up too? oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you. yeah, big brother. well that's a little crazy. although i am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the internet. yeah, well y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh? why?! to celebrate your relationship! to solidify your commitment! to declare your love for one another to the world! eh okay well that's good to know. the mr. bowmont's here!!! hey monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should i let him in? sure, i love this part! come on in. hi! richard! actually, i'm not here to complement the chef. ohh oh, that's okay i hate when people come back to complement the chef. like i have nothing better to do! so what's up? well, it was great seeing you the other night. oh, good to see you too. did you come down here to tell me that? no! i came here to tell you something else. i came here to tell you i still love you. what uh- what did you- what?! i still love you. and i know i probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, i mean you're with chandler a guy i really like, and if you say he's straight i'll believe you! after seeing ya the other night i knew if i didn't tell ya i'd regret it for the rest of my life. letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did. y'know you're really not supposed to be back here! well yeah, i'm sorry. i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya! i wanna spend my life with you. i wanna marry you. i wanna have kids with you. oh god why don't they put chairs back here?! i know this is crazy but am i too late? what the yes you're too late! where was all this three years ago?! well i know i was an idiot! and i tried to forget you, i really did! y'know after we had lunch last year i spent six months in africa trying to get you out of my head! what were you doing in africa? working with blind kids. ohhh! what are you doing to me?! oh look, i-i i'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen. okay that's fine, i'll walk away. and i'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me chandler's willing to give you everything i am. well he is! yeah, i mean marriage is all he talks about! my goodness, in fact, i'm the one that's making him wait! you are? yeah! why? why? because of the government. isn't it incredible?! monica and chandler, gettin' married. i know, they're gonna be so happy together. ohh i mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen? not that often! no! i'm so happy for them! me too! so happy for them! i'm so happy and not at all jealous. oh no! no god, definitely not jealous! i mean i'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. and i mean what's 2%? that's nothing. totally. i'm like 90/10. yeah me too. hey uh, have you guys scene chandler? wh- no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, tennille. so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you? sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. i mean look at pigs. let's take a second here and look at pigs. okay pigs don't mate for life. i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports! yeah, but that's pigs not people! if marriage worked, i'd be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%. wait a minute. are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married? well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never. oh my god! then-then-then what are we even doing?! what is this?! whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?! is this some new kind of strategy? why don't you put down your copy of 'the rules' huh mantrap?! y'know what?! i gotta go! ugh! it's okay, i got a plan. we're gonna find love! definitely! yeah, i'm pretty confident about that. that's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler! it would be nice to have a little guarantee though. what do you mean? well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other. you mean a backup? exactly! yeah, yeah i got that. you do? hm-mmm. who? joey. joey?! yeah! are you serious?! yeah, i locked him years ago! wh so if neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry joey. yep, we shook on it. yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal. oh, seriously? ohh, yeah. i think his exact words were charming. well hey, it's just a backup. yeah. hey monica! have you seen rachel? or a mirror? this is for my boat, pretty cool huh? yeah, it's great. whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! talk to the captain! i'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship! chandler giving you a hard time huh? it's not like i want to get married tomorrow! it's just that i-i'd like to believe that i'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that i'm not just wasting my time! well, you know chandler. no i don't know chandler! not anymore! it's like it's like something's changed. maybe you changed? i didn't change! maybe that's the problem. what?! chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife. is that some kind of boat talk? i don't know! i haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet. what does he think? does he think i'm just gonna wait around for nothing? monica face it, chandler is against marriage. and-and always will be! well there's some people who do want to marry me. there are? yeah! richard! r-r-richard said he wants to marry you?! and-and chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?! that's right. chandler loves marriage!! you just told me that he hates marriage! that-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! that-that he's against marriage and always will be! you got that from what i said?! what happened you guys? rach! hey you! hey, come on in. oh thank you. hey y'know, i'm so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth. oh, thanks. yeah, i really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, i guess it just wasn't meant to be. yeah, love. it's a tricky business isn't it? i guess so. so what do you say we make a pact? if you and i are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. i mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! you know what i mean? no like, ""what's that?!"" right. ohh! you-you want me to be your backup. exactly. ohh, yeah i already have one. what? who? phoebe. phoebe?! wait a- but-but she just, she said that joey was her backup. ohh, i don't think so. ross! i just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and joey made a deal! that's impossible! i mean we have had a deal for years! we-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that. where the hell have you been?! i was making a coconut phone with the professor. richard told monica he wants to marry her! what?! yeah! yeah, i've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off! my- oh my god! i know! they suck!! he's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! i'm supposed to do that! i know! well what y'know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna go over there; i'm gonna kick his ass! will you help me?! look, chandler i don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. okay? just go and find monica! you're right. yeah! okay. i'm gonna get the ring! i'm gonna get the ring! i'm gonna go find her and i'm just going to propose! okay. okay great. dude-dude-dude! what?! let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat. hi. hi. i don't know why i'm here. i didn't ask. you wanna come in?

you tell her jack, i can't do it. what happened? you still have the monica wedding fund don't you? we have it. only now, we call it the beach house. i don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house! we're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself. you bought the beach house when i was 23! which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie. we really do feel bad about this though. we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen. what about when i started dating chandler? well it was chandler! we didn't think he'd ever propose! clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. i can't believe it! that there is no money for my wedding?! we might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet. it seemed like such a simple idea. stupid jack, the word is stupid. all right, enough! i don't want to hear about it anymore! good luck, chandler. okay! now, i'm going to touch you. ohh, that's soft. i can't believe this. do you think that your parents could help pay for it? i don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. she's saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to dollywood. well what happened at dinner? my parents spent the money for our wedding! my god! what did you order?! wait, but there's no money! well this is terrible! you guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center! honey, it's gonna be okay. no! no it's not! it's not gonna be okay! it sucks! no swing band! no lilies! no, y'know what? it's gonna be okay. i mean you don't have to have this rustic italian feast. y'know? and-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. look, it really is gonna be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married. do you even understand what off the rack means?! look, why don't you just pay for it yourself? how? i don't have any money. well, i have some. how much? well, close to whoa!!! are you kidding me?! well what?! how-how much is it?! it's enough for wedding scenario eight. ohh! really?! how great are you, you little saver?! i mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding! ohh, you guys are so made for each other. well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding? well, come on, i've been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party. wow! hello, mr. chandler. this is the most special day of our lives. no, i realize that honey, but i'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party. honey, umm i-i love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. okay?

a hundred and forty-five pounds. in one year?! my god what did she eat? her-her family! that's not the point. look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15! well that's not the only time this was an issue. you remember when umm, you spent thanksgiving with us? you called me fat. okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different. how? you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back! what if i have babies, okay? i mean i'm gonna look different. i'm okay with that, but i'm not sure that you are! look you have to realize i don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. see this is one of things that i can apologize for later! look, what i mean is you're monica! okay?

'cause it's already happening. do you hear that? oh my god! oh my god! you have to go! why? because chandler still has feelings for you! he does? say again? that's right. that's right. and that is why you can't stay here tonight. and probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding. feelings, such strong feelings. i mean, i realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can. ohmy gawd, i-i understand. i-i am so sorry, i'll go. good-bye monica , i wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper. don't sweat it, i've got this section covered. yeah, in fact i've got this little baby to shine in people's eye- - okay, see you later. i just wanted to show monica your book."
7.0,8.0,Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs,"hey everybody! happy thanksgiving! no, no, no. no-no-no. what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year? no, we're playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes. what? that's like insanely easy! now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . it's a stupid game and i wasn't playing against other people, so technically i didn't lose. what? you forgot fourteen states? nobody cares about the dakotas. oh, okay, time's up! all right, i got 48. oh that's not bad, pheebs? oh, i got tired of naming states. so i decided to list the types of celery, and i have one: regular celery. okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead invegetables, joey? say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game. wow, how many have you got? fifty-six! hey! how is new england not a state? huh? they have a sports-team! does south oregon have a sports-team? there you go. how come we have one extra place setting? 'cause you invited your assistant. oh, right. sorry. but tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending thanksgiving with her. oh! why didn't you tell me? i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin. well, i was going to, but then i figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things. now you think i wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but i still do. regular celery! oh, i already have that. done! with time a-to-spare. oooh that may be a new world's record you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can't name all the states. did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" hmm? uh, magellan? you got 46 states. what? that's impossible. 46. wow! who's well educated now, mr. i-forgot-ten-states? all right, i'm out of oven space. i'm gonna turn on joey's. please, watch him! do not let joey eat any of the food! i am only one man! okay ross, time is up! no, just give me another minute. look ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself. this-this is crazy! i can do this! all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner. okay, but if you can'tno dinner! you're on! all right. don't look at my list, ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have. hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work? but the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right? ross, i'm gonna use yours, okay? pshhshhh! chandler? can you give me a hand? sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. don't worry, chandler, it's not a globe of the united states. hey you guys i'm gonna go out and take a walk. phoebe, why is your bag moving? oh, it's not! seriously, it's moving! what the hell is in there? it's just my knitting that's all! yes! i knit this. i'm very good. ross's apartment is nice! how come we don't hang out here more often? i don't know. maybe it's because it smells a little weird. it's like old pumpkins or something. that's my pie! which smells delicious! uh-oh! uh-oh! what? we left joey alone with the food! yep! yep, i knew it! there he is... feeding stuffing to a dog! hi geller-bing residence. how can i help? phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment? i'm sorry, who's this? phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! tell her, i'm allergic, and i will sue! no, there's no dog here? yes there is! he's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to rachel and licking rachel's hand. oh my god! where are you? i'll be right there! they're here already? how are they doing this? hi tag! what are you doing here? i, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you is still good. well, sure! come in! well, what-what happened to your girlfriend? we kinda broke up this morning. oh, i'm sorry. yeah, so she went back to ohio. ohio!! thank you! huh! where is the dog?! what dog? there-there's no dog here. yeah that dog left! phoebe! phoebe, open up! there's no dog in here. phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! no that's just me coughing! oh, good, there you are! listen, um, i have a dog in my room. what is it doing here? well, i'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. wait. hello, my name is clunkers. may i please stay with you nice people? oooh, i wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic! extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! that's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days really? chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? well, it still has to go, right? okay, it's um don't do it! don't do what? i have to! okay? it's time! okay, i hate dogs. what? are you crazy? are you out of your mind? why? told ya. they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. right, they are scary. ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!! wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies? is there a puppy here? you don't like puppies? okay, you are new! look, chandler, i told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. it's like ross not likin' ice cream. you don't like ice cream? it's too cold. okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. it hurts my teeth. and i don't wanna say this, i don't you guys to hate me, but uh, i don't think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go. oh my god!! how can i not get this? i'm a college professor; i got 1450 on my s.a.t.s. 1250. damn, i forgot you were here. all right. we're gonna take clunkers to ross's. we'll be back in a minute. oh, wait before you guys go, can i just ask you a question? yeah. when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move? oh, i'd say about a month. really? i'd say 3 to 4. half hour. interesting. when it's your assistant, i would say never. all right, rach, the big question is, does he like you? all right? because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point. huh. a moo-point? yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. it just doesn't matter. it's moo. have i been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense? please, don't listen to joey, okay. would you look at him? he-he's obviously depressed. he's away from his family; he's spending thanksgiving with strangers. what he needs right now is for you to be his friend. you're right, i'm sorry. thank you. okay, that's what i'm gonna do. fine! take their advice. no one ever listens to me. when the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside. hey! hey. how are you holding up? not bad. yeah? i'm sorry about your girlfriend. thanks. so were you guys together a long time? a year. on and off. i kinda thought we'd end up together. i don't anymore. now that she broke up with you? yeah. yeah. hmmmm. it's weird. i always used to assume, that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. but lately it's like what if it's not. do you ever have that feeling? noyeah, all the time, constantly. it's terrifying. but you know that i figure itit has to work out. why? because, uh- it has to. you have all the answers, don't you? yeah, i know, i do. i really do. hey, thanks for talking to me. well, what is a boss for? hug it out! all right, he likes you back! huh? told ya, you should go for it! what? street noise drowned any of that out? no, all right, i see you later, okay... what did joey say? i like you back? uh, yeah, well, see, he joey knows, that i'm-i'm very insecure about my back and, andyou're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah! wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense. no? all right, here's the truth um, joey said what he said, because um, i'm attracted to you. wow. yeah, i admit it. i have a crush on you, and uh, and, and i know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing i want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now. oh my god! those guys are stealing my car! what? right there! that's my car! hey!! okay, that's gonna take them a minute. do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest? i can't believe this! wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! oh look, there they go, okay. okay phoebe, we should probably go back now. please don't leave me, i'll be lonely. stop it. stop! okay let's go. we can be strong. yeah, okay. oh my god! did you hear that? she said monica! oooh, i can't leave her! you know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and chandler wouldn't even know. that's not gonna work. i've had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea. he's not so smart. hey! i didn't know either. yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you? yeah, i knew. where's chandler? here i am. wash your hands!!! how did youknow? hey! what's she doing back here? relax, ross. she's not made of ice cream! hey look, phoebe. i, uh, i laid out the states geographically... no, no, we don't really have time for this right now. okay, we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom. yeah, but, but look what i'm... see, this is exactly what we do not have time for. where's monica? um, in phoebe's room. you can't go in there. why not? monica's crying. she's very upset about this whole clunkers thing. well, i, i should go in there. no. no, no. she doesn't want to see you right now. why not? because you sent away the dog! this is ridiculous. oh, is it? is it? look, when monica and i were kids, we had a dog named rover. and, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. so monica and her friendphyllistake away the dog. and that was the last time we ever saw him. don't you see? this is just like that. only with a few details changed. okay, i'm in my sweat pants. bring on the food! what's the matter? monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away. so? bring the dog back, you're a hero. yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? chandler, it's like a big gerbil. and that doesn't scare you? ross, you need some help? from you? yes, please! first of all, utah? dude, you can't just make stuff up! i hate america! when i finish this game, i swear i am moving. hey! tag's still talking to the police. yeah, ohh! why, damnit, why did i open my mouth? i have a crush on you; i am attracted to you. gee, i-i know that i freaked him out if you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. hey, is chandler here? no, no he went for a walk. okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back! hi! oh no-no-no-no-no-no-no! he went over to ross' to bring the dog back here! oh no, the dog's not going to be there! you think? hi, honey. please, please, please, don't be mad at me. what? why, why would... shh, wait and see. maybe we will, maybe we won't. okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. y'know, for you, and i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which fyi ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. i couldn't find him, and i am so, so, so, sorry. but i do know where we could all go ease the pain. we have good news, look whose back! hi! clunkers?! oh my god! that's right, she came back all by herself. it's a thanksgiving miracle! it is so good to see you! yeah, she came all the way back from ross' building. oh, the things she must have seen! and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in i went to far, didn't i?

it's not just the drum noise. every five minutes, joey throws his sticks in the air, and i have to hear, ""oh my eye! oh god, my eye!"" i mean, it is so annoying. yes, thank you. you see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums. phoebe, you got joey drums to annoy rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?

i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember? what? did you bring me any presents, santa? you bet i did, ben, put it there! well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! ho, ho, ho! okay ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo, and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there's a sentence, i never thought i'd say. what are you doing? you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work! thank you, but, but you gotta leave. why? because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it. but i didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly. i'm sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me. fine, i'll give the suit back. hey, you think, you can keep it another night? santa? really? yes, is that okay? did your dad ever dress up like santa? no. then it's okay! okay ben, santa has to go. say good-bye! no! why does he have to go? because, if santa and the holidayarmadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. merry christmas! no! why can't the armadillo leave? i want santa! fine, i-i give up. santa, santa can stay. well, i'll stay, but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah? okay, santa! all right, it's time for the story of hanukkah. years and years ago, there were these people called the maccabees. merry christmas! oh wow! look at this place! oh, this is terrible. oh, they've made so many changes i can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore- ooh! new sconces! oh my god! what? okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms? yeah? and remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down? yeah? do you really not know where i'm going with this? it left! it's one huge room! oh no! oh! wow!!! see? well, i guess we'll just have to put the wall back up. you can't, because of the new skylight! there's a skylight?! wow!! so what should we do? should we start looking for a new place? y'know i'm-i'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that. oh yeah? startin' to feel her again there are we? a little bit, yeah. pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone? you heard her too?! you have the gift! phoebe, it's okay. i like living with joey. are you sure? oh please, i hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. although, i'm really gonna miss living with you. oh me too. i know. oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? listen, i'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give rachel the purple chair? no, i do not hear that. and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for eight whole days. that's right, and that's why we celebrate hanukkah today. the end. awesome! yeah?

forget it! we are just hungry! we have not had lunch! we are just light-headed! so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake. yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted. good idea. where do you want to go to lunch? momma's little bakery, chicago, illinois. awww! mel torme died. joey, that paper's like a year old! aw! does that mean the sam goody's sale is over?! hey. hey. hey. so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall. limited seating?! i am just one tiny person! well yeah, but she doesn't know that. i mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling. limited seating! oh, that is such a lame excuse! that's not the reason she's not inviting me! oh what's the big deal?! i wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. and-and y'know what? if it makes you feel any better, joan and i will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest. joan? yeah, joan tedeski my date. she's an assistant professor in the linguistics department. tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed! wait a minute, you got ross gellar and guest?! i wasn't invited and you got ""and guest?!"" uh-uh, excuse me, i do have to interrupt on ross's behalf. i-i think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back not broad backed! wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me! what? i can't cancel on joan! why not?! bec- did you not hear me?! she's an assistant professor in the linguistics department, okay? they're wild! why do you want to come anyway? because! she's my cousin. i mean, we grew up together! we're family y'know?

wait a minute, i didn't pay, i thought you paid! so apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. do you see what i see? its still there! mrs. braverman must be out. she could be out of town. maybe she'll be gone for months. by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake. no that could kill her. well, we don't want that. no so we're protecting her. but we should take it. but we should move quick. why?

sorry! joey, joey i am so sorry. i told you not to move it! rach, how would you feel if say, i wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and i did it anyway and her head fell off? okay, come on- joey, i'll buy you a new one! all right? we'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair. she's not even cold yet! but don't you think rosita would've wanted you to move on? i mean y'know, she did always putyour comfort first. that's true. okay? you ready? yeah, i i don't want stevie to see her like this. i can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room. well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down. they kept your room for a while. oh please! dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out! i gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of victoria's secret catalogues, not a gym! come on, you know they love you. as much as they love you? i was their first born! they thought she was barren! it's not my fault. hey. hey. hey! ugh, i hate this year! what's wrong with this year? well okay, it's already february and i've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world! that was me and ross. oh that's right! hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing. oh that's a great idea. you're really good on the phone. yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had. y'know, i probably wouldn't have to say spank as much. what? oh yeah, like you never called! so basically this is very easy. you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can. okay, i can do that! oh, by the way, i love my office. why don't we do a trial run. oh okay. umm, all right. hi, this is phoebe from empire office supplies, can i speak to your supply manager please? i'm the supply manager. umm, okay i would like to talk to you about your toner needs. we don't need any toner. oh okay, well i'm sorry to bother you. bye-bye. yeah you're right, this is easy. okay, what was wrong with that call? oh well, all rightum, no offense, but you were kind of rude. they're always going to tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script. oh. so, i think you're ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions? no. oh wait yes! i do, i do have one question. what is toner? joey! joe! full bag. beer's still cold. something terrible must've happened here! oh no-no-no-no-no-no! stevie, i was never here! dad? i'm here! hey! hi. god, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work. dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house. well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling. let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here. i'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore. oh, that's okay, i can't wait to see everything again! all of the memories well, i don't know what's in the boxes down here, but i do know there are six or seven easy bake ovens in the attic. i used to love to play restaurant. yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater. hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! so, i think you're boxes are over here. wow! great! wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these? i don't know. they-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. i'll throw these away. cool! dad! my report cards! hey, check this out dad, math, a. science, a. history, a. gym oooh, my rock polisher! oh look, look there's your old makeup kit! it's a clown kit! clown kit! well, the white seems to be untouched. uh-oh. what? y'know how the garage floods every spring? how are you ever going to sell this place? i think i accidentally used monica's boxes to keep the water away from the porsche. oh no. dad! dad! what oh godeverything's ruined! dad, she's gonna be crushed! you don't secretly smoke do you? no! so it's just your mother then. hi, this phoebe from empire office supplies, can i speak to your supply manager please? earl, thanks. hi earl, this is phoebe from empire office supplies i'd like to talk to you about your toner needs. i don't need any toner. i'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner. not me. may i ask why?

it's just that i uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows i exist! chandler? i-i'm sorry? no look, i-i'm sure that people know you exist! oh yeah? i work in a cubicle surrounded by people. i've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no one's even looked up from their desk. hang-hang on. hey everybody! uh, i'm gonna kill myself! i'll get back to ya. i got nothing. wait. uh, hey marge! ehh, nothing. nothing. my chair. now, if anybody asks, your name is rosita! you will like it! no i won't. you don't even know! because, i know what i like and what i don't like! it's not the same thing! well look, if you don't like this i don't know why you say that so soon. come on joey, i just bought you a new chair! the most expensive one in the store! hey, y'know what i was thinking? we could name her francette. francette? what is she? a couch? poor thing. cut down in her prime. joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. maybe we should actually move rosita out of here. y'know, start the heeling process? well, i guess you're right. maybe, maybe i'll take her down to the incinerator. it's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. she's heeled! that's weird. no it's not weird, it's a miracle! it's not a miracle joey! i'm sure there's some explanation. oh there is! if you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen! joey, i really don't can you tell me how this happened? well no. miracle! no, y'know what? maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! or something! someone like anangel? that's right joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. get your non-believer ass outta my chair! well, she'll understand right? it's not like i did it on purpose. dad that won't matter to her. look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! see, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her. oh my god, does she really thinks that? well, can you blame her? well i don't know, i-i suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! the doctor said your mother could dad, dad i don't want to hear about it. really? well, not right now. okay look, monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! okay, grabgrab some empty boxes. okay? we'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their. great! like uh y'know like this! this! she-she could've made this! sure! right? and this! she-she could've won this! this could've been hers! sure! ooh-ooh, what about this? your make-up kit? i'd feel better. i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself! yeah, me too. hey, how'show's the uh, miracle chair? fine. yeah? wow! y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest! no. really? yeah! you can hook it up to your tv and you get radio! my chair heels itself. earl, you're not hearing me! all i'm saying is that you're not alone all right? everybody hates the people they work with! hey guy! wait, what was that? that sounded like someone being nice to you. no! that's just the ""hey guy"" guy. he says that to everybody! he's the worst! i'd like to take him with me! all right so earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? there-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! what about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend? yeah! right! oh sorry, boyfriend! oh no. no, whatever! anything! hey guy! yeah, he's gotta go. okay, i should, i should probably be getting back to my thing now. see ya. no! i'm not finished yet! don't! don't you dare hang up on me!!! the new girl's good. hey guys! hey! hey. hey, i just whipped us up some easy bake treats, they should be ready in about three days. that's a good one! do you hear that ross? three days! yeah! yeah! oh, this will make a great memory. okay. so, which boxes are mine? well, these. these are yours right here. okay. oh! a coloring book! yeah. yeah, oh you loved that thing. you always had it with you. you never went anywhere without-without that coloring book. really? wow! it looks like i had some trouble staying inside the lines. nu-uh! oh, an old glove? oh, yeah you loved that glove! you took it every place you went. you never went any place without that glove. wow! look at this! i can't believe i even fit into this shirt! oh, this is yours. oh, i don't know how that got in there. this isn't mine. hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! ugh, ross! these are your boxes! where are my boxes? umm, your boxes are umm what? dad? well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. i'm sorry. just mine? i'm afraid so. so why-why wasn't ross's stuff ruined? and if you say the words medical marvel i'm going to easy bake your head! well, i used your boxes to divert water away from the porsche. so wait, ross's stuff is fine, but i have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!! there was also leaves and guk and stuff. i can't believe this! screw it! i'm having one. hey chandler! hey! how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest? yeah, i'd love to but i've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore. well what if i told you, you can do it in my apartment? are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year? i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000. that's awesome! that's great! what made you do it?! well, it's a long story, but umm i broke joey's chair whoa-whoa-whoa! you broke joey's chair? yeah. i thought i broke joey's chair! that's why i replaced it with mine! ohhhhh. that's how it got fixed! well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it? noo! angels. i'm gettin' my chair back! what? wh-hey! well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! yeah! so, i guess this chair is mine now! joey you broke my chair!! your chair?! yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs! so, there was no miracle?! no joe, no miracle. oh no this is devastating! my faith is shaken. i'm so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life. uh-huh! nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! all right? that is my chair now! you can sit on my lap! no i take that back! i think i should get the chair! how do you figure? because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! the only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me! no-no-no! this chair's not going anywhere. well, where's the logic in that?! the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half! so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing! that's right! what are you guys? like a gang or something?! yeah! we are! we're the cobras! excuse me! can you tell me where i can find earl? he's the supply manager around here. sorry, i don't know any earl. i'm right here!!!! earl! i'm phoebe. phoebe? the lady who sells toner? umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself. look, um i really appreciate your coming down no-no i can't! i can't let you do it! why?! because it was fate that made me call you today! i thought it was toner. no! think about it okay? this isn't even my regular job! okay? and my first day on the job, you're my first call! and-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but i wouldn't do that because i know about this stuff. my mom killed herself. really?! yes. how? i'm not gonna give you tips! look don't you see that this-thisthis all came together so that i could stop you from doing this. couldn't it just be a coincidence? no, it's fate! it doesn't really seem like enough to be fate. oh. well umm, okay here's a weird thing. my mother was also a supply manager. i'm actually the office manager. oh my god! so was she! and! get this, okay? your-your name is earl, right? her name was pearl, p-earl. well, was there anything else?! sure! umm, where are you from? philadelphia. oh my god! so was she! oh, i've got-i've got goose bumps. really? well, y'know i'm wearing layers and it's warm. yeah-yeah. but if- no look, okay. these jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! and that says a lot! did you hear that?! i don't need you guys to care about me! because the universe cares! the whole universe! i really wished they'd care just a little bit though. y'know, i don't-i don't think it's you. this is a freaky place. hey! guys! oh no, it's you. yeah. oh, this terrible! everything is destroyed! look at this. it obviously meant enough for me to save it, and i don't even know what it is! ohh, it's still soft. what do you think this is? all right. i think it was a mouse. how are you honey? how do you think i am?! you've wrecked all my childhood memories. you love ross more than me. and i just rubbed a dead mouse on my face! sweetheart, we love you just as much as ross! now, i'm sorry about everything that happened and i'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start. what's this? it's the key to my porsche. well, the key to your porsche. what?! what?!!! i've been thinking about getting rid of it. i was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. your mother's right, i do look like an ass. wait, you're giving me your porsche, you're kidding me right?! well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! i mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a porsche?! why don't we take it for a spin? all right! well, what about me?! i'm a medical marvel!! oh yeah. ahhhh. ahhh eh? uh-huh. hey guys! hey! hey! do you guys know what happened to chandler's barca lounger? oh yeah, joey broke it. had to get rid of it. are you kidding?! i get a porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! this is the best day ever!"

you okay? yeah, it's just y'know monica said wedding. uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony. oh! i would love to read a poem. do you think you could get through a poem? it'll be a short one. okay, so ross will be doing the reading. ohhh okay. yeah, i guess, i guess i could do that too. too? yeah, i kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys. do you mind telling us what it is? sorry, i'm kinda keeping this one on the q.t. well, whatever it is, i hope it involves winking. hey! hey! so i just talked to one of the dool writers today, and what is dool? days of our lives. anyway, you're not gonna believe it! my character is coming out of his coma!! oh!! that's great! and-and-and not only that, i'm gettin' a new brain!! so great things are happening at work and in your personal life! wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain? oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body. what? a brain transplant?! yes, it's a highly controversial procedure. it's ridiculous! well, i think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months. it's winter, they are fewer people on the street. who are they killing off? uh cecilia monroe, she plays jessica lockhart. she's my favorite character on dool. nice. she is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, i mean i don't think i've ever seen her finish a beverage. and the way she slaps all the time! oh! wouldn't you love to do it just once?! don't do it. cecilia monroe man, what a great actress. oh, tell me about it. and she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain transplant,"" you are going to be her? yes, but in drake remoray's body. why is this so hard for you to get? i thought you were a scientist! rach, so, that guy there. straight or gay? well, i'd have to say gay. yeah? why? well mainly because he's kissing that other guy. oh no not that guy there. that guy right there. oh yeah he's too cute to be straight. ohh knockers will help us figure it out. all right, straight, and not subtle. ohh, he left his cell phone. oh, well, we can hand it to gunther and he'll put it in lost and found. or we could use it to call china. see how those guys are doing. what if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fell in love. i mean wouldn't that be a great story? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. yeah that does sound great. i'm going to get the phone. what? wait! whywhy do you get the story? i don't know. i haven't been out on a date in so long. phoebe, you had a date three days ago. that wasn't a date! that was, that was just friends getting together having sex. okay. okay, see? i get the phone. no way! no way! you just broke with tag a week ago. yeah! and until now, i didn't think i'd love again. nice try. oh hey-hey wait! how do we fairly decide who gets the phone? i don't know. well umm, maybe we could uhh ah-ha! too slow!! ah-ha! too cocky! i'm going to keep dating him mother, and there's nothing you can do about it! oh yes there is! what are you going to do? kill him? like you did with charles?! that was an accident! and so were you. well, at least i'm not a murderer! oh, my baby! cut! that was a great scene! and-and-and that slap looks so real! how do you do that? oh, just years of experience. can i get some ice here?! oh anyway, i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are. you're not the fan who's dying are you? say what? i'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later! no. no, i'm joey tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. i-i'm the guy in the coma! oh that was a real person?! an-an-anyway i-i just wanted to say that since i'm getting your brain when you leave the show, i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me i-i-i'm leaving the show? i don't know. why? did you hear something? who told you that? oh uh, one of the writers. which one? was it bald or was it tall? umm y'know what? it doesn't matter! because it is not true! okay. and if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that i've been playing for 20 years- i'll give you a tip! ms. monroe oh there you go. no phoebe! you cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! okay look, i have an idea. why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. and then whoever does gets the phone. or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone. i don't think so. fine all right, but i'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet. all right, first name on the speed dial is mom. ohh, i lost my mom to suicide. okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin. did i use that already today? i'm sorry. yes okay. well now see this isn't telling us anything. joe. carlos. peter. ooh! peter luger! t hat's a steak house! okay, a meat eater. fine, that's one for you. oh, i win! he's got barney's on his speed dial. so you don't know that's barney's the store! that can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. who has barney's the store on their speed dial? his new girlfriend! what is that? i think it's the dying cat parade. it sounds like it's coming from across the street. oh my god! what? y'know that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding?! he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""you're half scottish right?"" nooo!! yes!! no, there is no way! it can not be ross! unbelievable! why is your family scottish?! why is your family ross?! he cannot play at our wedding! i mean everyone will leave! i mean come on, that is just noise! it's not even a song! if you listen very carefully, i think its celebration by cool and the gang. hi pheebs! hi! how are ya? good. umm pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that i was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone? yeah. and remember how i said i was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang i could just pick it up? yeah! and do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?! ooh, now you lost me. you stole the phone! no i didn't! no? so you're saying that if i called it, it wouldn't ring? no. umm, okay. but while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. oh, it does work! phoebe! that is a different phone. oh is it?! uhh, hello? yes hi, is rachel there? yes she is, just one moment please. it's for me! that is damning evidence. oh my god! i bet that's him. my digital fairy tale is about to begin. i wonder how i should be? should i be uh hello? or should i be hi! it's rach would you stop doing that?! hello? yes, i'm the one who found your phone. phoebe! you can't do th shhh! i'm on a call! umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? at-at my apartment. it's umm, it's umm 5 morton street, apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. okay, well okay i'll see you then. bye. you do know that i will be here when he comes over. oh? and how will you know what time to come over? you just said it! oh. okay, well i-i was kinda hoping that i would justbe alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide. oh phoebe! what?! that's the first time today! ohh! so you like the nachos uh? myself i'm partial to i'm 16. see you in 2003. you're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. they don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it. i'm so sorry. look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show. yeah, thanks. no i mean it! i can't believe they would do this to you! and to your fans! i mean they are going to be devastated! heart broken! they love you so much! oh you're right. thank you! what's your name again? joey. joey, well thank you. that is so sweet. oh, excuse me. it wasn't my decision! i'm having a conversation here! you were saying? uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye- l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that i, that i came up to you before was because well, i'm really nervous about-about being you. y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. y'know? help me keep jessica alive. please? all right joey, i will help you. not because i-i owe it to this stupid show, but because i owe it to jessica. oh that's great! oh thank you so much! you're so welcome. hey! now, i've been watching some tapes, how's this? ""jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again! ever!!"" is that supposed to be me? yeah. yeah but jessica doesn't have an english accent. i can do an english accent?! that baby's going on my resume! well, i feel like a snack! do you want some shortbread? eh that's scottish like you are. oh no thanks. i don't like any thing from my scottish heritage. what?! well it's just my entire family was run out of scotland byvikings. anyway, lots of bad memories. oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its scottish roots. no! no-no they're not. they're still very angry! but y'know chandler is also half-swedish. you know what the swedish people are famous for? sitting down and being quiet. well yeah-yeah the scottish history is so much more you can not play bagpipes at the wedding!! how did you know about that?! we heard you play all the way from your apartment! were you the ones called the cops?! that's not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding. why not? because we hate them. come on that's not fair! i mean you haven't even heard me play! we have heard you play. no, you've heard my practice. okay? just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. and i'm not going to tell you what song i'm gonna play either. but uh, let's just say when it's over i'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration. so, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. so, when jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. you try. okay! all right! no, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! he's not finding it out for the first time! so, try it again. okay. okay. right. he's not angry at the room either. try it again, he owns it! he owns the room. it is his. he owns, owns, owns, owns the room! he owns it!! all right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. oh well, i'm gonna miss this woman so much. i don't know what i'm going to do! i mean, it's been 20 years of my life. oh well- hey-hey! maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. y'know? it'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. you're so talented. i am. i am, but i don't know you know. an actor of a certain age is not that easy. hey that's not true! look at uh, look at angela lansb- angelina jolie! i probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know i just got so comfy here! and ohh, i turned down some amazing work! like-like what? well, let's just say if i left 15 years ago, the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today! wow! but well now, now's a different time for me. oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? now when i watch you do a scene, i'm thinking, ""boy, she-she is a great actress!"" uh but-but, i am also thinking, ""she is hot!"" you think i'm hot? you own the room. we should probably get-get uh oh yeah-yeah, we should get the so when jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face. yeah-yeah, i noticed that! is that 'cause she's so passionate? no! it's because that way the camera only sees her! do you wanna try it? yeah! okay. that was good, that was really good. but i-i think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like hey! hey! whoa! why do you get to answer the door? well why shouldn't i?! because it's my apartment! well, then i get to give him the cell phone. okay. all right. good luck explaining all the calls to china. hi! wow! how long were we arguing for? you're not the man who left the cell phone. no that's my assistant. is-is he coming? umm, no. could you-could you umm, give us one second? sure! we'll be right back sir. sure. wh-what do we do? i don't know! can you believe this? we were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up! i know! what?! hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore! no-no they do but, you just have to wait. rachel, listen- i mean, if you let me have him then i will really owe you one. all right. all right phoebe i will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big! yeah! you're such a great friend! ohh so, which one of you lovely ladies am i going to take to dinner huh? oh that'd be me. sir. after you. okay. okay. nice! well, you certainly own that room. actually i rent the whole place and, i just got what you meant. thank you. hi. hey! oh my god! oh my god!! ohh, jessica lockhart!! in my apartment!! i am such a huge fan! i am such a huge fan! well, it's nice to know that you monica!!!! monica!!!! that uh, that is my roommate rachel. oh that explains all the women's underwear. sure. yep. oh my god! it's true!! oh my god you are so amazing! oh my god, can i just ask you to do me oh, just one favor? certainly. would you slap me? would you slap me right here in the face?! i'd love to, but my lawyer said i can't do that anymore. god. you seem really, really nice. okay, bye-bye. i mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people. all right, here we go. okay. oh wait, just one more thing! one more minute! umm, you're a stupid bitch. i really can't slap you. you are so beautiful. nice to meet you! my god you're great! thanks for stopping by. see ya! i-i am so sorry. i oh no-no-no-no, being adored. i'm used to it, don't worry about it. oh my god! what? they sent me today's script! they never send the script! they don't? well no, i'm just in a coma. this must mean i have lines! oh how does it happen? ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence. ah what?! jessica hates horses! yeah well, i'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either. now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt. i can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks. do you wanna start telling secrets? no! now umm, remember i'm still learning. one, two, three, four! you know the song! sing along! so? loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant fredrick. and the electric fence, inspired. thank you sweetheart. i can't believe she's really gone. look around you, all of this is ours. i don't think so. who are you?! what's the matter dina? don't you recognize your own mother?! that was so wonderful! ohh, i think that you're a better jessica than i ever was! oh noo well of course not, but you were very good. thanks! and guess what? good news! i got another job! great! hey! all right! well-well what is it?! a film in guadalajara! the airport? no that's la guardia. this is mexico. ohh. wow! well how-how, how will you be gone? eight months. that's a really long time. yeah, but you can come and visit me. i bet that you could uh, own a few places down there. well i tell ya, i should probably buy a place in the city first. and i just got what you meant again- that is- i tell ya, that is a tricky one! that is a tricky one. well, joey i really wanna thank you. you've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful. good luck. you too. you know the song! sing along! eeee!!! eee!! eee!! eee!! do it again!"

you said the waiter ate my crab cake. yeah. so uh ross, well now- why did that first marriage breakup? was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian? do you two know each other? no. it just seems like ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge. wait a minute! were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

7.0,19.0,Ross And Monica's Cousin,"oh hey! how was your audition? i'm sorry, do i know you? what are you doing? nothing, i'm just practicing blowing you off because i'm gonna be a big movie star! oh! you got it?! well, no not yet. but the audition went really good. what was it for? oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three italian brothers who come to america around the turn of the century. it's really classy! oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next martin scorcese. the next, next? yeah, there's this guy from chicago who's supposed to be the next martin scorcese, all right? but then this guy's right after him. hello! joey! it's estelle! i just talked to the casting people; they loved you! they loved me! yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow. oh my god! there's just one thing. do you have a problem with full frontal nudity? are you kidding me? i never rent a movie without it! oh. uh, okay uh let me call you back. what's the matter? they want me to be totally naked in the movie! wow! i know! my grandmother's gonna see this! grandma's gonna have to get in line. hey the wedding is so close! are you getting nervous? yeah. but a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. chandler and i have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding. a no sex pact huh? i actually have one of those going on with every woman in america. hey phoebe, will you give me a hand? sure. i gotta make up the guest bedroom. hey, cousin cassie is coming to stay with us a few days. cassie? uh-hmm. wow, i haven't seen her for like forever. i wonder if she still carries that barbie everywhere she goes. ross, she's 25 years old. so what! i still have- no you're probably right. hi! hey! hey! hey pheebs, can i talk to you over here for a second? yeah! subtle guys! what?! i know you're planning my surprise bridal shower. well okay- well don't ruin it! just play along at least! okay. sorry. oh my god! we have to throw her a shower?! hey! what did you decide to do about the movie? i don't know! it's not like it's porn! this is a serious, legitimate movie. y'know? and the nudity is really important to the story. that's what you say about porn. you're right. maybe i shouldn't even go on the call back. no! no you should! a lot of major actors do nude scenes! i mean the chance to star in a movie? come on! well that's true. and i am only naked in one scene. plus it sounds really great. my character's catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl. who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. it's really sweet and-and tender. plus, everyone's gonna see your thing. well when can we have this shower? she has got so much going on we-we have only two options. we have friday well that's only two days away. what is the other option? yesterday! well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! we're done! oh my god phoebe, this is impossible! we can't do this by friday! we have to find a place. we have to invite people! we have to get food! there's just too much to do! it's impossible! we can't do it! we cannot do it! we cannot do it! rachel, calm down! okay. i'm sorry. you're right, you're right. just calm down woman! phoebe, i already, i already did. oh okay. all right, then i need to calm down a little. okay. okay. i think we can do this if we just get organized. all right? we have two days to plan this party. we just need to make fast decisions! okay? all right, where are we gonna have it? uh, here. what time? 4 o'clock. food? finger sandwiches and tea. ooh great! very monica. and chili! ah you went one too far. uh, flowers or balloons? both! we're paying for this y'know. neither. okay. umm, what should we do for the theme? lusts of the flesh. what? i don't know. a cowboy theme? hey! hey! y'know i'm-i'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding. oh boy me too! y'know i was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours yeah? technically we could have sex again. what do you think, bossy and domineering?! the wedding is off, sloppy and immature! that's me! come on! okay. but wait, we can't. my cousin cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch. well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill. shrill?! the wedding is back on! i thought i heard voices. you must be chandler. hi! nice to meet you! nice to meet you too. so, are you ready to go? yeah. chandler! i'll be right with you. cassie needs to stay at your place. what- why? because purvry perverson over here can't stop staring at her. what?! chandler she's our cousin! i was not staring at her. okay? i was just listening intently. it's called being a good conversationalist. watch. say something. you were staring about eight inches south of there. fine, she can stay at my place. by the way, what-what does cassie even look like now. she looks exactly like aunt marilyn. umm, so this aunt marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding? wafer thin ice! hey, i'm back! hi-hi joey. uh so, will-will i be reading the same scene again? actually, i tried to call to you. you didn't need to come down here today. oh great! y'know i would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! good day! wait joey! you didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it. and scene! huh? wasn't that fun? we did a little improv there. yeah! okay! so you-you-you-you were saying? well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow. wow! sure! that's great! oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity. yeah! yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold. terrific! well uh, there's one more thing. uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. yeah and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't jewish. so sowhat? so uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not jewish. do you know what i'm saying? yes! okay. no. what? an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be barmifsaed? so to get this part you can't be? nope. but you are? yep. but you told them you weren't? that's right. wow! wow! and it's definitely all gone? there's nothing there to work with? what were you thinking? i don't know! i really want this part! and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! and just figure out how to do it later. joey! this is not like learning to ride a horse! this is like learning togrow a turtleneck! i kn-i know! i know! okay? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like. oh my god, what are you gonna do?! i just have to call my agent and tell her i can't do the part. unless! unless what? well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion. like what? well i'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head i'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat. hey! i've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone. okay. okay. all right, you take care of that. and meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list. okay. okay! well okay, who do we know that's coming? me. are you? hey! hey! hey! what's up mon? well uh, i'm trying to make something for joey. do you mind if i raid your fridge? have at it. okay. all right, turkey. eh, that won't work. cheese? that won't work. olive loaf? i hope that won't work. are you makin' him a sandwich? no it's umm, more like a wrap. okay so uh, i'm gonna go guys. i guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! we have to get her a present?! okay but look! look at what i got! it's her address book! we have a guest list! oh my god you're amazing! did you just pull that out of her purse? uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. cassie?! hey ross! hey! it's been so long! last time i saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see return of the jedi. oh. oh, that's right. so-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't. ah yeah, sorry about that. it's okay. come, come on in. thanks for letting me stay here! i mean monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot. oh. oh my god! you do a great chandler! uh-huh. yeah i-i have a knack for impressions. well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me. yeah- no!! cassie, how you-how you doin' on thathot dog. i'm all done. thank god. i guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together. oh right. right. ooh, remember the time i uh, i pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? we're probably too old to do that now. i'll always remember that summer, because it's when i got all of these freckles. uh-huh! uh-huh! and-and-and i'll always remember that summer because that's when i realized that we are related. it took you that long to figure it out, huh? well i'm, i'm a little slow. just as our children would be. hi! hi! how are you? good. hi, thanks for coming. oh thank you. thank you. no? all right. oh, it's so nice to see you. no. okay. hey rach? yeah? who the hell are all these people? well, i don't know. i called all the people in monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice. hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. losers! hi! i'm rachel. this is phoebe. i'm the maid of honor. how do you know monica? i was her accountant four years ago. ohhhh! i'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years. that's great! so, what time is monica supposed to get here? excuse us for a minute. you didn't tell her to come?! you were supposed to tell her! no i wasn't! you were supposed to tell her to come and i was supposed to bring the cake! fine, i'll go call her. yes! and please tell her to bring a cake! okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on. wow! this looks great! yeah! okay, this one is a mushroom cap. umm, this one is made of bologna. and-and-and-and-and the toothpicks? oh, just until the glue dries. thank god! now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. ah. okay? over here we have pink suede, which is nice. but umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink. well maybe we just take that one away. i also, did a little something in fur. but umm, that's really just for me. okay. so, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see- get a better idea of what's gonna work. thanks, you are such a good friend. and this is so weird. ow! toothpick?

let's back up a second. she was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. she was the one who turned down the lights. she was the one that wanted to rent logan's run, the sexiest movie ever. oh, i know that look. forget it. i want it. she wants it. i'm going in. hey! what the hell are you doing?! say something clever! okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. say some words. any words will do. oh my god! this is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! there is nothing you can say to make this worse!! so just say something!! i-i, i uh haven't had sex in a very long time. yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything. phoebe! rachel! it's monica! i wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! oh. oh monica, we are so sorry. for what? well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower. and then for forgetting to invite you to it. you al-you already had it? yeah. well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave. yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either. we ruined everything. ugh well no wait a minute that's not true! no, what did, that was really sweet. and it kinda works out for the best. what do you, what do you mean?

whew! that was a brisk ride! take the top down did ya? only way to fly. come on ross give me the keys! monica does not know what she's talking about! i am an excellent driver! you're fast and irresponsible. that adds up to a bad driver. well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader. did you see the look that girl just gave me? huh? she must've seen me cruising in the bad boy. i think she's checking out your beehive ross. what?! give-give me a brush. gimme the keys! no way! well no brush! fine! y'know what? it doesn't matter, because, if i remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom. alimony. chandler, we still haven't gotten an rsvp from your dad. oh! right. umm, maybe that's because i didn't send him an invitation. chandler! he's your father; he should be at the wedding. i don't even know the man. okay? we're not the close. i haven't seen him in years. well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?! well he doesn't have to know! it's not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas. ooh, i think i wanna trade circles. trust me, you don't want him there either. okay? nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress. so what! as long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil i don't care. okay, i think i need to do some shopping. ahhh! ooh, nice! my god! what do you think you're doing?! just washing the windshield. there is no way i am letting you drive this car! so why don't you just hand over the keys? oh. she puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. does anyone know why that is? it's a tradition left over from porsche's racing history. the world's greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans. which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday. in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. at the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. the driver's left hand did nothing. porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. that's why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.} no ah-ah-ah! do not start this car! okay! okay! i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! look ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car! with you?! yeah right! all right. okay! okay! okay! what are you doing?! get in the front! in the death seat?!! oh my hey guys! hey! hey sweetie! ready to go? yeah! sure! ooh, i left my purse up at monica's. i'll be right back. wait a minute! what? oh. ooh. whoa! that one kept going. so! you and phoebe huh? how long have you been going out? over a month. wow! maybe uh, maybe you and i ought to get to know each other a little better. sure, i'd like that. so uh, what's your name? its jake. joey. hey jake, do you like the knicks? yeah, big fan. me too! there's a game on tuesday do you wanna go? yeah that would be great! let me make sure i'm not doing anything tuesday. here! what's this? it's your suitcase. we're going to las vegas. are you serious?! i mean like eloping?! no more stupid wedding stuff?! no more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers- think of the money we'll save!! we're not eloping. i love the flowers. can our wedding be bigger please? we're going to las vegas to see your dad. it's time you two talked, and i want to get to know my father-in-law. y'know we already went over this and i won! no you didn't. oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore. look forget it okay? i don't want to go. i don't want to see him. i don't wanna. chandler, look i-i know that your dad embarrassed you. i know no-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through. when i was in high school, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet. y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. you're skinny. you're wearing speedoes- that your mom promised that you would grow into! and you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda. we was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack! hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! okay? that's a, that's a pretty great dad. he had sex with mr. girabaldi! who's mr. girabaldi? does it matter?! chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. okay? maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. if your father's not at your weddingyou're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. yeah o-okay, but i'm just doing this for you. yes! so i really never get to win anymore? how much did ever really win before? pheebs! hey! listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward i check out your underwear? yeah! well, when jake did it i saw thathe was wearing women's underwear! i know. they were mine. oh. no! no wait, that's weird! no, it's not! we were just goofing around and i dared him to try them on. that's weird! i'm wearing his briefs right now. that'skinda hot. i think so too. and that little flap?

he is all man! i'm thinking even more than you. oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys. i'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! i don't think you could ever do that. hey! i am secure with my masculinity. okay whatever. you've seen my huge stack of porn right?

umm i'm never gonna getting married! yeah you will! the right guy is just around the corner! okay, are we done with that? no monica! i'm serious! oh, maybe i should just forget about it. become a lesbian or something. any woman would be lucky to have ya. well maybe it would make me feel better if i slept with joey. rachel! you okay? excuse me, aaron? hi! umm, i have a little problem with the schedules. originally, i wasn't supposed to work today, and i have this wedding that i really have to be at. it's my best friend's, and i'm officiating so i really can't work past four. joey, you gotta stay until the end. we can't stop filming just for you. it's not like it's your wedding. i'm having surgery! what?! yeah, i-i just made up the stuff about the wedding because i didn't want you to worry about me. but, i'm having surgery today. what kind of surgery?! transplant. but you're supposed to work on monday. hair transplant. but you're not bald. it's not on my head. look joey, there's nothing i can do. besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. we've just got one short scene. it's just you and richard, and god knows he's a pro. you'll be fine. morning richard. hey! you're here! great! great! great! let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot! i'm wearing two belts. are you drunk? no! yes you are! all right. we are never gonna find him! he's one guy in a huge city! oh my god! is that him? that is an old, chinese woman! he could be in disguise, y'know. aw, y'knowy'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. if you're chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on earth people would think you'd go? so this is your office? how did you guys find me? i knew i should've hid at the gym! what the hell are you doing?! panicking! and using the internet to try to prove that i'm related to monica. how is she? she's fine. she doesn't know you're gone. and she doesn't have to know, okay? now come on, we're going home. no! no! no! i can't do that! why not?! because if i go home, we're gonna become the bings! i can't be the bings! what's wrong with being the bings? the bings have horrible marriages! they yell. they fight. and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games! chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room? no. then you are neither of your parents! it's not just their marriage! i mean, look at yours. look at everybody's! the only person that can make marriage work is paul newman! and i've met me; i am not paul newman. i don't race cars! i don't make popcorn! none of my proceeds go to charity. but look chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than i do. but i totally believe you can do this. i want to. i love her so much, but i'm afrit's too huge. y'know, okay. you're right. it is huge. so why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? okay? umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. can you just come home and take a shower? well yeah, but then yeah- no-but-but-but-but! we're just gonna go home and take a shower. now, that's not scary right? depends on what you mean by we. the nights are the hardest. but then the day comes! and that's every bit as hard as the night. and then the night comes again the days and nights are hard! i get it! okay? look umm, rachel i'm sorry! i have to start getting ready! i'm getting married today! i know. at dusk. that's such a hard time for me. i'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour! okay. but wait! what?! let's go to lunch. i can't go to lunch!! right. oh good god! i've fallen down! what's going on?

7.0,24.0,outtakesFriends Special: The Stuff You've Never Seen,"conan o'brien transcribed by: eric aasen this is a special out takes episode. the cast and conan are sitting around the set of central perk, talking about the stuff we've never seen. this is stuff we never saw from all of the seasons, so for all of the scene settings i will be using the current arrangements. even though some of the out takes take place when chandler was living with joey and rachel was living with monica, when joey and chandler were living in monica and rachel's, and the current arrangements. it's a tradition here on friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys, talk down the episode umm the point of this whole thing is what people see in america is: they see friends, they love the show, it looks like a smooth running machine, but behind the scenes there's deceit, mistrust, and hate. and i thought, i thought we'd actually take a look at uh, y'know some of these moments where you guys are- there are mistakes. you make mistakes. once and a while. from time to time. for example, i don't have to memorize lines. you guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. yes? our energy just comes way up when there's an audience here and when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesn't, it just doesn't work. uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn't. i did. oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. so, we realize that- oh no i'm telling it! i'm telling it ha-ha. look- come on, i don't know what to door say. ha-ha, very funny. i don't know what to do! y'know? holy crud! ha-ha-ha, very funny. look, i don't know what to do! it is one of those days! 'xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay- - uck it! wow pheebs, you-you speak gutter? you still get nervous everybody just before a show? absolutely. everybody. it's amazing like all week long we've-we've been saying the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once, then you'll get nervous because you'll- you know you'll probably mess up again. action! when you were little you slept through-through the grand canyon. watch again that hand. this'll be five/ten takes. okay. okay. you know it's gonna happen. once again, and action! when-when you were little you slept through the grand canyon. oh! okay! i'm gonna try it without the coffee cup 'cause i think it's the left hand that's messing me up. when you were little you slept through the grand- - oh fffff. sorry, let's go back! 'cause you've got more to say. do i? absolutely. absolutely. yeah, that's your fault. isay. i love you. i love you! but there must be, there must- are a lot of moments over the years where you're just trying to do your job, something goes wrong. hey and, this is a little extra something for y'know, always being there for me. hey joey! the camera hit our wall! what?! ahh! sh- - it that hurt! are you okay? hey rach! oh yeah? then how come i keep- it was so wild! we told 'em we were the gunderson's in 16 i spit on her! operation. you had a fun one. oh yeah! with operation. it was a little game. yeah, with an electric buzzer. oh-ooh, and i brought operation, but umm i lost the umm it's making a noise. but le blanc really doesn't mess up much. you don't verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? you mess up. i have had some clumsy moments i guess you can call 'em. he fell down once! and we re-did it and we went back. and he- - he was afraid he was gonna fall down you could actually see him trying not to fall down. pheebs! check it out! this particular time when he continued to fall or y'know, try not to fall, i was in the room with matthew and matthew was like, ""should i do it?"" pheebs! check it out! check it out! check it out! check it out! ooh, soap opera digest! matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. i mean like if something's naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. true or false? i don't necessarily like to juice things he said true or false! oh! ooh-ooh! what are you doing?! you're still a tiny bit on fire there. oh geez! okay! thanks! it was great seeing you the other night. well, it was good to see you too. did you come down here to tell me that? noo! i came down here to tell you something else. i came here to tell you i still love you. what the fu- - ck are you doing?! now you guys work with animals a lot. you had to work early on with a monkey that damn monkey. that damn monkey. okay. okay, see now the one with the feather boa? that's dr. francis. she used to be a man. oh look! there- okay. katie. geez! see katie, come here- katie! katie, come here katie. very good. lisa's laugh thoughthere's- it's so infectious. it's one of those thingsjust forget about it. once it starts, it's all gone. no y'know, i don't want to switch! come on! i can throw wet paper towels here! well at monica's you can eat- okay, shh yeah. 'cause it's not silly. here we go. okay. andaction! no-no ph-ph-ph-ph ready? yeah. and then it just builds on itself and there's no doing the scene after. i mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it. for me, i have a hard time with le blanc in particular. when-when- i mean when you bastard. yeah, what did i do? i keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to you, or a certain take, i-i- i mean i find it so funny. mornin' mornin' i mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can't even say, ""hmm, noodle soup?"" that's a good one? now, we should go back and take the other line. okay, i'll just put a little more booze on there. i think, subconsciously nope, you lost me. no! come on! okay, the next situation is for rachel. the wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find monica taking a nap with ross. i'll be monica. go! no! no! no! we'll be right back with more friends, less me. i'm doing my brother. that'sgross. you uh, you've worked with- they always say a performer should never work with pets or children. aww, the kids. action. okay. now- what is my first line? what did we agree? okay the good thing about the young kids though, they're completely unpredictable. which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. but there was one story oh little ben. where the story was that i was anticipating that i would be around to hear my son's first words spoken. but the scene was about that he wasn't supposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show hi! we're visiting! yay! it's ben and his da-da. da-da? can you say da-da? y'know, you might as well say it because i told your dada. can you say da-da? see, i'm gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try dada. huh? dada. yeah, he's saying da-da. and then sometimes during the show y'know but you're like, the scene's going one way but you're just tempted to say something another time. like, do you remember that one where monica's baking cookies in our old apartment? she's trying to intrigue us to hang out with her. yeah, she's trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place, and we're sitting there eating pizza and i think it was you that said what do i smell? i think i was supposed to say, ""i don't know,"" and go over and open the door. and i went what do i smell? sorry. and then it was like four takes later before we could get through it with a straight face. what do i smell? le blanc. what do i smell? i don't know, but it smells good. but audiences- you have a live studio audience and they must love that. they must love it when they see you guys playing. what are you guys doing? nothing. nothin'. so that you will intentionally do something that- they'll-they'll intentionally screw it up? yeah! yeah! why? what's the matter? you-you've worn a fat suit on the show. and, a lot of people love you in the fat suit. do you like wearing the fat suit? is it fun? i'm melting! they made me dance, in the fat suit. i-i heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimes there's just a word that someone has to say that you'll get hung up on. and it'll just- the way you say the word is funny to everybody else. that tastes like feet! it tastes like feet! okay, we're good. action! that tastes like feet! sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and you'll- we'll be rehearsing during the week and you just- whatever-whatever the joke is; it's so funny we can't get through it in rehearsal and just you just know. you-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, ""okay show night, i'm just- i'll never be able to get through this."" are you saying that you don't want to get with this? you see, i don't say- oh, sweet je- - sus! oh! monica, these are the cookies they serve in hell! whoa! she's purty! oh yeah, and she's really nice too! she taught me about y'know, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting. joey? i'm sorry excuse me, what? when you have to do physical business for a scene, i mean there must be; there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a scene. yeah, rachel, chandler, and ross had to try to get a couch up a stair- a very narrow new york stairwell and that was probablyi-i think it was the hardest i've-i've laughed in my life period. pivot! pivot! okay, pivot! piv-at! pivot! piv-at! piv-at!! shut up! shut up! shut up!! pivat!! pivat!!! you've done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80 years from now you'll be thinking about? it is when we're able to crack each other up. monica's gotta have the phone in the right place and- all right! all right! all right! we are fixing it. he's gone. he's we enjoy watching each other. and i settle for watching each other's performance, and we like each other. oh the band's ready! and well- i-i- we gotta do what the band says, right? i don't care about the stinkin' band!! okay friends gang, thanks for doing it. well thank you so much. thank you conan! well thank for coming here, it's good to see you. thank you my babies. oh what are doing?! you're still a tiny bit on fire there! i think you got it! i'm sorry, i messed up. i'll do it again and again if you want. no-no! i'll-i'll that is too much! let me start that again."

drake, i've discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss. what is it? apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. it seems your body is rejecting jessica's brain. is it serious? not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain. well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that. we would, but when we went to exhume jessica's body, it was gone. cut! very nice people! okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner. well don't- what happened to jessica's body?! i'm not telling, you'll have to see it on tv! you don't know do you?

please? all right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there! that's fair! thank you so much. thanks. oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too. i paid to have this done. love it! hey! hi! oh you know uh kash, really liked you the other day. he said he thought you were charming. i thought i was a complete idiot. hey, i'm with you. he even asked me if i thought you'd go out with him. oh! oh, i think i'm gonna throw up a little bit. what did you say? i said no. what?! what? ii just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people. okay joey, first of all kash ford is not people. second of all, what did he say when you told him i was pregnant? i didn't tell him. i didn't know if you were telling people. this is back when i thought kash was still people. good-good, don't tell him. don't tell him. just have him call me okay? rach look, i really don't think that's such a great okay, you go do it! i'll come back to that set! i'll meet more actors! i'll meet 'em all! hey bob. hey! how's my pal toby doing today? if i see him, i'll ask. toby! hey-hey! bing? was that bob from six you were just talking too? yeah! oh then you know each other. we're on a semi-first name basis. what do you think of adding him to our team? bob? ooh, working here with us? everyday? yeah, i don't know if he has what it takes. really? they love him down on six. but this is eleven. it's almost twice as hard up here. okay, i hear you loud and clear. bob will stay put. i think it's best sir. but we really do need to find someone up here. the work is starting to pile up. i've got a stack of documents on my desk this high. y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em. that's a good one. what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?! hey! hey. okay, i gave him another chance, but tim has got to go! but no! no-no! he is totally incompetent. i called the chef who recommended him to me. he said, ""ha-ha! gotcha!"" okay. okay, but you can't fire him today. why not?! because i'm dumping him today. what?! you said he was sweet! he is sweet. he's too sweet. he calls me all the time. ""so did-did you get home from work okay?"" ""did-did you get out of the shower okay?"" just don't pick up your phone. then he comes over! ""i'm so worried about you."" uck! be a man! what? so now i'm not allowed to fire him? you can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself. okay well then, i'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week. are you kidding?! another week with that sip, i'll kill myself! okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it! okay. but the question is who's gonna go first. 'cause whoever goes second is the bitch. what do you mean? come on! the boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! and the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch! i wanted to do this days ago so i think i should go first. all right, that makes sense. ugh. but- screw you i'm going first! hey toby, you got a sec? sure, what's up? i just had a meeting, i was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but i just found out its not gonna happen. apparently somebody thinks i'm not eleventh floor material. say uh, who the hell is this chandler? hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why i'm not drinking on this date tonight. ""umm, i'm a recovering alcoholic. i'm a mormon,"" or ""i got so hammered last night i'm still a little drunk?"" hey! hi! hey! so, what do you want to do tonight? there's a ukrainian film at the angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. interested?

i set her up with this actor on my show. you set her up?! no joey what-what were you thinking?! well, i was thinking that it'd probably be okay because ross hasn't gone out with rachel in five years! joey, i'm not worried about her! i'm worried about my baby! whoever she dates my baby dates! now-now where is this actor taking them? hey! i'm an actor too! i'm not sure. i think they're taking the ferry out to some italian place on staten island. a ferry? my baby is going on a ferry? do you have any idea how dangerous those are?! are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour? why don't they just jump out of an airplane?! huh?! that-that's a fun date! or burn each other with matches?! that's fun too! whew!! hey joey. hey kash. uh hey-hey this is ross. ross, this is kash. hey. hi. i-i hear you're going on a ferry tonight. yeah. a bit of a daredevil are we?

i'm getting a hundred. a hundred?! well, i-i guess i'll take a- mona, uhi-i'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing. really? why not? sending out a holiday card, together, i mean i just don't know if we're really quite there yet. oh y'know, i didn't think of it that way. you're right. you're right. so, can i ask you a question? yeah. where are we? huh. y'know, like where are we? where is this relationship going? hmm i mean i love spending time with you, y'know i just- i hope we're moving forward. i mean, we should probably talk about that. don't you think?

yeah, we're not just doing a card! y'know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going. ugh! women! i know! i know! why do you guys need to have this conversation?! huh? i mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""so, where is this going?"" uh ross? you asked me that. hey! you were a closed book! okay? i'm not a mind reader! besides, i hate those conversations. i'm horrible at them. really! maybe-maybe i need kind of a gesture. y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it. like asking her to move in with you? smaller than that. making her a mixed tape? uh, bigger than that. give her a key to your apartment. whoa-hello! we were closer with the mixed tape. all right. have you said, ""i love you?"" you could say, i love you. yeah i-i don't-i don't think i'm quite there yet, but i could say i looove spending time with you. no, we hate that. that is a slap in the face. forget it. i-i- y'know what? i'll just have the conversation. i'll just say i like things the way they are, and hope for the best. what do you think rach? i think, if it was a little colder in here i could see your nipples through that sweater. bing! we're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock. oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. monica has to work. oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. fine. tomorrow night then. oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either. oh? why not? it's the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament. what's going on bing? does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something? well now-now you're just talking crazy. so why can't the three of us go out together? because uh... we-we... we split up. monica and i split up. hold me good god bing i... well i can't say i'm altogether surprised, i saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. and the way she looked at me, pure lust. y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. can i choke ya? bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this. now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club. oh no-no-no, monica would freak. but to hell with that bitch. here we go. mona umm, i think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us. yeah, i-i think i suggested that. aw, we-we are so so umm, well i-i-i like you and i-i love umm, y'know hanging out with you. and i mean-i'm having a lot of fun. okay. i mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. it's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? so where-where is it going? ah! that's-that's the real question. and-and the answer isis it's going somewherefun. now i-i know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. no i mean- no not you, not you, you- you are getting younger. i mean- you-you look like you're getting younger by the second- what's your secret?

okay, he was talking about rules. uh-huh. umm, and looking at people differently. he didn't say anything about that to me. what did he tell you? he was asking all these questions about you, me, and london. and, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules. okay. so you, me and london. looking at people differently. maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone. but what did he mean by rules? wait a minute! he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in! because he was looking at her differently. and phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules! my god! he wants to do it with phoebe in london! you guys?

unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. you did see the folder. you know it's a boy! i didn't see anything! i actually changed my mind about the name. i don't think so! you're just giving me ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia. i would- sequoia? veto. fine. unless you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named ruth! well, i'm not falling for that! okay? ruth is off the table! but ross, you want the name ruth! not like this!scene: rachel and joey's, joey is sitting on his recliner as phoebe enters.] hey. hey. well, what's up?

no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love, but soul mates, i don't think they exist. okay, good. why? well last night, i met monica's. what?

well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat. hey. hey. i just talked to joey, i just- i want to see how you were. oh y'know, i still- i can't believe it. joey and rachel i mean it's it's like you and me going out, only weirder! all right, i know you're hurting, and-and i want to be supportive, but don't say that again. oh my god! what if, what if they get married? then he'd be the stepfather of my child. honey, i don't think that's something we need to worry about! first of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. and even if he did you have no idea how she'd react. sure, because women never like joey. y'know, i think he's a virgin. joeyhe's not even thinking about going after rachel! he's not? no! all he's thinking about is how you're taking this! i mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. he's talking about moving to vermont. why? he says he wants to leave the country. he thinks you hate him. hate him? i no, i don't hate him. it's just it's rachel, y'know? honey i can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. but, i don't want you to lose joey over it. and right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend. okay. okay, i'll talk to him. all right. now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money. oh! hi! hi! umm, chandler, monica, this is don. oh, hello. hello. soul mate. what?

on a barbecue chicken pizza? no? so don, what-what other restaurants do you like? well, octavio, 27&7- oh! and there's this great little place, alessandro's. oh my god! that's my restaurant, i'm the chef there. you're kidding me! no! your food is fantastic! wow, i really want to talk to you about your menu, once i get some coffees first. um, anyone want any?

i just- it just keeps gettin' harder. i don't, i don't know what to do. y'know? what do i do? i think you need to tell her how you feel. okay that's the green stuff talkin'. no, i'm serious. you-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this. but what if uh- and i'm not saying she will be- but if she is where you are then uhthen my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way. are you sure? yeah. look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. so hey thanks. so when do you think you're gonna talk to her? oh my god i have to tell her! i haven't even thought about what i will say. what should i say? i'm understanding, but let's not get carried away. i'm sorry, you're right. what am i gonna say? oh! yeah, tell me about it. so i've been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things. cheese you say? that's some pretty smelly work, huh don? excuse me? cheese, it's smelly. you must smell a lot of the time too. uh, not really. but when it comes to cheese, i'm one of the people who thinks the smellier the better. me too! yeah, chandler can't stand it. he won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house. and you're still married to him?

uh huh. and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar! ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible. but having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem? it was really fun being married to you tonight. yeah! and! and, it was the easiest 400 bucks i've ever made. okay ross, can i uh, can i ask you something? yeah. that proposal, at the planetarium i know, i know it was stupid. are you kidding?! with the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! it wasreally wonderful! did you just make that up? no, actually i thought about it when, when we were going out. it's how i imagined i uh, i would ask you to marry me. well, that would've been very hard to say no too. it's a good thing i didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. okay, good night goodnight even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up? i will think about it. that's all i'm askin' okay that's it. i give up. at mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech. y'know i don't understand why they didn't cry. it was a beautiful speech. oh, come on. hey! all that stuff you said about true love, you were right, i mean, we did learn a lot from mom and dad! and that picture of chi-chi with her mischievous grin. and what you said about nana. ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. and you know what?

the wheel has not been my friend tonight joey. uh, i'll take another question. okay, this is gonna be tough. hold your breath. it's okay, i'm ready. no dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question. this is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, trisholy cow, that's a big word. trisc seriously look at this thing. chandler, how do you say that? let me see that. this one right here. triscadecaphobia. the fear of triscuts! no! no, fear of the number 13. fear of triscuts? it's possible, they have really sharp edges. all right chandler, you're up. wait a minute, i-i believe i'm entitled to use my angel pass for a free turn? this game makes no sense! y'know what? you're just upset because you're losing. oh come on ross, i think we're all losers here. all right. chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a google card. let me think. let me think- oh! i don't care. you-you must choose mr. bing. either, it makes no difference. choose, you jackass! i'll take a card. okay, you picked the gimmie card! you get all of ross's points! what?! this game is kinda fun. you don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you i don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other. why did you invite my mother?! what? she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby. for how long? eight weeks. i mean i love my mother, but my god, a long lunch with her is taxing. i personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me. she can't hear you. what? you guys, come on! what am i going to do? well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her. you're right. you're right. i mean i'm about to have a baby, i can tell my mother that i don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! oh my god! she's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. this cannot happen! that's right. that is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. do not take no for an answer! okay. this is great! now she's gonna be mad at rachel! y'know what? and i'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had. i have new respect for chandler. all right everybody! it's time to open the presents! yes! yes! and i think that the first gift that rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. and in the world! well uh, i don't have a gift because i wasn't invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone's attention. how about you less important people, let's open your presents! mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift! well, i kinda did. me. eight weeks of me. oh yeah. okay, see mom, the truth is i can do this on my own. sweetheart i know you're gonna be terrific mom, i just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning. but mom, i really know what i'm doing. i can handle this. really? remember twinkles? he was a hamster! i am not going to vacuum up my baby! okay, come on rach it's present time! y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together. it's kinda falling apart here. oh look. wow! okay, this is from your friend at work. oh my gosh! oh wow! oh, i know what this is! wait a minute. that can't be right. is that a beer bong for a baby? darling, that's a breast pump! did i say i was done guessing? okay, thank you for that. oh wow! what's this? it's a diaper genie. oh, it dispenses clean diapers! no! it's where you put the dirty ones! well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster? oh you're gonna do that ten times a day? what?! it goes ten times a day! what are we feeding this baby?! indian food?! no dear, that's what babies do. rachel, listen to your mother. she is very smart. plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you're trotting out to the garbage ten times a day? i don't know, i'd leave it on the changing table? what?! what'd i do? what'd i do?! you can't leave a baby alone! oh come- - of course i know that. i mean of course you never leave a baby alone! i mean who would- she wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. oh god, okay. y'know what? i think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. so i think umm, i'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. and for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful. it's actually a bassinet. okay mommy, don't ever leave me. in what john houston film would you hear this line, ""badges?

the baby's coming and i don't know what to do. oh, can i throw up in my diaper genie? no. sweetie, you're gonna be fine. wait-wait where are you going? where are you going? i'm going to the bathroom. okay. now don't worry! everything's gonna be okay. it is going to be okay! it was worth a shot. hey! hey! why are you all red and sweaty?

you spin the wheel of mayhem to go up the ladder of chance. you go past the mud hut through the rainbow ring to get to the golden monkey; you yank his tail and boom! you're in paradise pond! yeah all that's gone. it's basically just a simple question and answer game now. well what's fun about that?

nothing! you have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. and don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it. y'know what? you're-you're right. yeah i mean if you want to say anything to her, i'd tell her off. really? uh-huh! okay! i will! mrs. green? mrs. green! it is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! now what i did to you, it wasn't on purpose! but what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful! spiteful?! that's right! maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young ladyold ladylady! wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up so whenever you're ready to apologize to me, i will forgive you. good day! i can't feel my legs! you were fantastic! i'm so proud of you! yeah?

the chef! that's right. i think you'll find if i come to work here, i don't micro-manage. i don't shy away from delegating. um-hmm, that's good to know. but let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do. what i do dois manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me. i see. nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way. hardest thing i've ever done in my life. you gotta go! oh! okay, don't worry. you're ready. really? absolutely! just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great. okay. ah monica, my star student. y'know, you called me that before so i-i took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. oh, yum-yum-yum. wow! a star! i know you all hate me and-and i'm sorry, but i don't care. okay joey, you're up next. this are good! this is amazing! you get an a! i can an a?

all right. now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties. i see. but there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them. good to know. we can go into detail no don't i beg of you! all right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on monday, but i think i can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here. really?! absolutely. you can relax; you did great. yeah i gotta say thank you, i was really nervous. y'know i've been told i come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. duties. duties! poo. poo?

do you not, do you not like katie? no! no, she's- she was nice. i mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't? i liked her. of course you did ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you indiana jones! did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?! no! it's just that, kate bothered me. why? what was wrong with her? there was nothing wrong with her! all right? she was perfectly lovely! okay, so what's the matter? i don't want you to date her! why? what, what are you jealous? yes! and not because i want you to go out with me, but because i don't want you to go out with anybody! okay? i know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but i want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! i'm very sorry, but that is just the way that i feel. okay. what?! i won't date. i'll uh, i'll be here, with you, all the time. really? but i'm being so unreasonable. true, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. you're having our baby. oh ross, thank you. thank you. do you feel better? no, not really. you're pressing the baby into my bladder and now i have to pee. sorry. uh rach?

""i thought i knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."" okay, this is it. it's my big fight scene coming up. ross. yeah? can i ask you something? uh-huh. when carol was pregnant with ben mmm? were you this irritating? wow! excuse me?! oh nothing. nothing! just uh, you've been a little short with me lately. i'm not trying to irritate you. well then you just must have a natural talent for it. y'know what? the doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then. okay. seriously, breathe louder ross! that's great! y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil! hi dr. long, how are you? oh, you're nice to her. she has the drugs! we'll do a quick check. okay. so, eight days late huh? yeah. you must be a little uncomfortable. eh, just a tad. you're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way. it still could last a little while longer. if you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along. do them!! actually, they're things you can do. just some home remedies, but in my experience i've found that some of them are quite effective. well, we are ready to try anything. okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink. okay. you can take some caster oil, there's eating spicy foods great! we will do all of those. taking a long walk, and then there's the one that's proved most effective: sex. you've got to be kidding me! good job joe! well done! top notch! you liked it? you really liked it? oh-ho-ho, yeah! which part exactly? the whole thing! can we go? oh no-no-no, give me some specifics. i love the specifics, the specifics were the best part! hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? did-did you like that part? i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic. you fell asleep!! there was no kangaroo! they didn't take any of my suggestions! that's for coming buddy. i'll see you later. don't go! i'm sorry. i'm so sorry! look! this guy fell asleep! he fell asleep too! be mad at him! or, call an ambulance. hey! hey. hi! what did the doctor say? any news on when the baby will come? no. but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor. yeah, we tried them all. we went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked. well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that, ""that will open up a can of worms."" well what is it? what is it? if it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. i mean, i think you should do it. it's sex. do it! monica! i'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. i mean, women have needs. do it, get yours! oh i-i don't know about that. no, i think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. all right, let's be practical, if ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. you can borrow chandler- chandler is good! monica, what is the matter with you? nothing. i just want the baby to be born today. why? why today? okay fine! i keep betting phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and i don't want to lose again! what?! while she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! you're betting on your friend staying in this misery?! i'll take that bet. what?! well, i'm miserable here! i might as well make some money out it! can i get some of that action? wait a minute! now i'm betting against all three of you? oh honey, don't worry. i really do feel like tomorrow's the day. oh, okay! hey! sleeping beauty! where have you been?! i tried to call you! i want to talk to you! i still feel so bad! oh no, were you upset? did you lose sleep? i'm so sorry. uh-huh look, the only reason i can over here was to settle things between us! okay? you've done a lot for me and my career, i wanted to pay you back so i took you to the premiere but you missed it! okay, so how much do i owe you? what?! give me a number, i don't want to owe you anything! you don't owe me anything, i don't want you money ah-ah-ah! we're doing this! okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. right, how much were those? i don't know, five hundred dollars? okay, five hundred dollars. what else? well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots. okay, so that's another five hundred. five hundred and five hundred, that's do you want a calculator? please! here! all right, what else? well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes which we're still keeping under our hats! uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. which after twenty hours of lessons still came out jamaican. what the hell are you talking about, ""the south will rise again man."" yes, money well spent! yeah. okay, what else? rent! okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food okay. okay, so i'm writing you a check forso you fell asleep during my movie. big deal right? how do you clear this thing? come on, finish your enchilada. ross i- we tried all the spicy food. it's not working. okay here, have one of these peppers. oh ha oh god! soso hot! oh my- by the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye. i am feeling nothing. speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you. stop it. oh come on ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! we know what's gonna work! it's doctor recommended! i'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! my god, i'm dying. oh come on ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy. this is insane, i'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor. make love? what are you a girl? always a great way to get in a man's pants. but you will, you will be performing a service. okay? just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out. i love when you talk dirty to me. oh, i know it. you're right. that's not sexy. ohoh! whoops! oh, i seem to have dropped my fork. let me just bed over and get it. oh god! okay enough! this is, this is not going to happen. come on ross! i'm miserable here! come on! you started this, now you finish it! come on wuss, make love to me. y'know what? what?! forget it. oh wow! what now ross you're not gonna talk? how on earth will you ever annoy me? oh wait a minute, i know. i mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! that's not enough what are you doing?! i'm getting that baby out of you! oh god! oh, i know. oh no. no-no! i think my water just broke. i am good. okay! okay! uh, i got the pillow! i got the bag! you got the keys?

i hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two are on your own. well that'sy'know- that's- we've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. besides y'know what? i-i- maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately i-i- things have been happening between me and ross, y'know?

no! no, come on let her sleep! she's so exhausted. and so engaged. what? oh my god! she-she thinks we're engaged! why? why? why would she think we're engaged?! perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? y'know ross doctors are supposed to be smart. i didn't give her that ring! really? no! so whose ring is it? it's mine. is it an engagement ring? yes! but you didn't give it to her? no! but you were going to propose? no!! huh, i might be losing interest in this. look. look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel, but all i wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again. oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment. look, i didn't want to rush into anything. and it seemed like she didn't want to either. but i don't, i don't understand how any of this happened! what? did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that i was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people? no! no, she said you actually proposed to her. well i didn't! i didn't propose! unless uh did i? i haven't slept in forty hours andit does sound like something i would do. look, we can't stay in here forever. oh, i still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! he didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees! this is okay. we're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. hi dad! i can still call you that right? of course. i'll always be your dad. i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun. it wasn't fun?! why? why-why-would you- wh-why look, i just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want. oh, i don't think that. before today i never thought of you two having sex at all. it was a simpler time. the truth is, dad, we're-we're trying. what? yeah, we're trying to get pregnant. oh my god! this is so exciting! well, get back in there! i'll guard the door! well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later. whoa-whoa-whoa! i don't think so! aren't you ovulating? daddy?! well you gotta get at it princess! when your mother and i were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. that's how i got my bad hip. that's funny, this conversation's how i got the bullet hole in my head. this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was daddy! i don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex. you're right, you're right. this is about your positions. now, what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good. i don't feel good right now. but pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. you up to the task sailor? seriously sir, my brains? all over the wall. hey. hey. i need to tell you something. well, now's a good time. i'm on my way to have my ears cut off. joey asked me marry him. what? joey proposed to me. is he crazy?! you just had ross's baby! well, i-i said yes. what?! are you crazy?

no! she had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out. joey, you have to tell her what's going on! and what did it look like?! i didn't look at it. stupid baby's head was blocking most of it. go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out. look, it's not that easy. she said she wanted to marry me. i don't want to hurt her. okay, look, just do it gently. you're right. you're right. i-i'll go tell her now before ross finds out and i'll be gentle. i can do that. i am a gentle person. oh, by the way. two people screwing in there if you want to check that out. hey. hey. listen, i um i heard about the engagement. surprised?

excuse me? i know what she's talking about. we've got to find a new pediatrician. ross was getting sick last night, and i think emma may have caught it. why don't you go see dr. gettleman? ross said he died. he didn't die. i saw his daughter last week. said he was fine. her on the other hand, botched botox. oh, great! well, then i'm gonna take emma to see him. i wonder why ross said that he died. oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist. he saw a therapist? yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out. why? what was it? that i was going to eat him.  mike!!! yeah? okay! i gotta tell you, i can't believe i'm doing this with you. although i did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so i guess i should be open and taking some risks. everything is gonna be fine. just follow my lead, okay?

that's the kinda thing you usually run by me. i always wanted to play piano professionally, and i figured if i don't do this now, i never will. wow, that's great! i liked that better than the law thing, so... which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike. i thought you thought he was still a lawyer. no, no, that's not what i meant. let's get you a cocktail.  hey! hey! what are you doing? looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa. that's so sweet. find anything? slim pickings. nothing, huh? no, 'slim pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. they're looking for a cook. actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. they're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.

wha-wha-wha-did you do ross! oh boy you got mad at that part. i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah, blah, blah, and i ended up telling him that. what! umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum. what! why? well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship. if you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now! well phoebe, i think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum, his a kite designer and he used to date oprah. i'm not going along with some lie you made ross, no i'm just gonna be honest with him. good yeah just be honest with him. yeah i've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. ok i haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so i'll just be alone forever you know alright i'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. i'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh i'll get it ok you know i'm trying to think of the last time i opened a door and you weren't there, phoebe are you ok? uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know vicrum just called. joey is back at hayley's place after there date. so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, i kinda took it the hardest cause i was the youngest. uh huh, sure, yeah. how can you not remember me? what? how could you not remember that we slept together? what! when? i dunno! i really, really think i would remember sleeping with you come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was a certain amount of time ago, i was here you were here, we had sex here, here, here not there. anything?

well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because i never really have been in a long-term relationship, i've never lived with a guy, and i've never even celebrated an anniversary so. if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave i totally understand. in fact i'll close my eye's make it less awkward you kissed me. uh huh so you don't think i'm a total freak no. well look can i think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you. i guess so, can i. can i think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers. definitely this is vicrum. chandler arrives home and monica's got a video of sharks ready for chandler. hi honey i'm home! : hi, how was your flight?

do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier. no i'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all. : oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. or does it always have to be sharks? does what always have to be sharks. : honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash. what's going on? : sweetie it's ok, i still love you, let me be a part of this. let me be a part of this! i saw what you were doing in tulsa. angry sharks turn you on! no they don't then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat. oh my god! when you came in i switched the channel, i was just watching regular porn really? yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl american action. i cannot tell you how happy that makes me! you are an amazing wife. no really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, i mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that. : im very, very drunk right now.  phoebe is in central-perk with joey telling him what ross said t her at the beginning. see ordinarily i would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her? did i not sleep with her? you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious. your right! i love my life! i actually did sleep with her."

no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny... i really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. i mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... sandy, that's exactly what it is... are you gay? ross! it's okay. i get that a lot doing what i do. but i am straight. i-i'm engaged actually. oh! her name is deliah. oh, that's pretty. so you're just like a... guy who's a nanny? i realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but i really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child. okay. like in my last job, i met daniel when he was three weeks old. and i got to watch him grow into this awesome person... when i left, i said: i'll see you soon... and he said to me: skdandy... that was his name for me... i'll see you every day... right in... yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. oh god, she mu... she must need her diaper changed. oh, oh, i can do it for her, if you want... oh, that would be great! i love him, i love him, i love him... oh, come on, rach, he's a guy! so wh..? he's smart, he's qualified. give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out. because, it's weird! why? what kind of job is that for a man? a nanny? i-it's like if a woman wanted to be... yes? king? i er... i hope you don't mind. i used some of my home-made lotion on emma. it's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. it'll dry that rash right up. plus... it keeps the hands young... please? yes! sandy you're hired. that's great! i'm sorry. it's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family... oooh... ***i really can't hear what she says*** come here. you gotta be at least bi... hey! i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks. ooh. i-i don't know chan. i'm not so good with remembering lines. well, thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it. i know, right? wh... wh... why are we doing this? monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she's ever met. seriously? she actually said that? yes! am i crazy to be this upset? nooooo! being funny is your thing! yeah! without that, you just got ""lame with women"". ye.... hi! there you are. fire trucks! wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday. oof... in fact, ehm... i going to kiss you now. oh, wait, wait! yeah, i-i don't, i can't get away with stuff like that. i-i-it sounded sexy in my head, so i... no, no, it's not that. uhm... remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no? well, uhm... i am. his ... his name is mike. oh... oh... yeah, i should have told you. no... well, yeah. i'm sorry, i'm sorry. well, i-it's okay. i-i-i understand... well, s... well, are you happy with this guy? i am happy. damn it! i-i'm sorry. i-i don't mean that. i-i want you to be happy... but only with me. no, uhm... that's not fair. uh, who cares, leave him!. oh, i don't mean that. yes i do... i'm sorry uhm, i... i think i should probably uhm... go... well... but david, just... i just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things i've ever had to do. well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a vladnik carnival either... can we at least hug goodbye? of course, yeah. you know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate... no... no... i mean... in minsk... yeah? ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips. well, if that's what they do in minsk... in new york... it's... oh... oh boy... hi... is everything allright? oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful. well, her favourite flower is the camellia. from the poem... i can't... i can't hear it again. you know, i can't tell it again... and i'm fine never having heard it... rach, can i... can i see you for a sec? yeah! excuse me... do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? huh? i haven't cried that many times since i moved in. look, ross, he's just... sandy is just sensitive, that's all. okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. he is too sensitive. what...? too sensitive to take care of our baby? yeah, i mean, all things that guy... these are amazing! sandy made madeleines. this... this is exactly what i'm talking about. what kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate french cookies, huh? they're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. well, i... you know, i-i-i don't know what to say... i mean, i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. you know, 'cause i gotta tell you ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle. hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive. okay, what? what is too sensitive? hmmm... no, no... no, i can't do this. it's bad. but... i-i-it's nice... a-a-and... nice is good. a-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing. no, no. no. but... ergo... look david, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and i-i'm with mike and i really care about him... uhm... uhm... goodbye... uh... schto ya ztez vigul... ui... well... hey, the key works...! and you thanks for the face massage. thank you. did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?

guys do that...? that's... weird... thank you! that's like a woman wanting to be a... ...a what? a what? what's the end of that sentence? yes... what is the end of that sentence? uhm... a penis model. anyway, hey... did you tell chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met? yeah, so? wow! really? do you not know chandler? is that why he's acting so weird...? he's jealous...? oh my god, that is crazy. it's not like i'm attracted to geoffrey... so what? being funny is chandler's thing... you know, like ross's thing is... science...? academia...? being a good father...? ...no... i can't believe he's that upset about this... monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'cause he's feeling like... hey! heeeyy! hey! what are you guys talking about? uhm... rachel and i hired a male nanny. you got a man who's a nanny...? you got a manny...? you know, i don't mind a... male nanny, but i do draw the line at a male wetnurse. ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister! if i'd known you guys were coming over, i would have brought more pizza. okay, okay... chandler you... you stop it! what is so funny about that?

i'm sorry. i would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with... oh... that's true. thank you! well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. so you see wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare... i am learning so much from you. well, i'm off to tulsa, so if your maitre d. friend has any funny oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com. honey, you can relax. last night at work, geoffrey told this really sexist joke. after that, not so funny anymore. really...?

naaaa... he still kills me. last night he had me laughing so hard, i swear... a little pee came out. here goes... i can't watch. it's like firing elmo. sandy... hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. i'm afraid it's not working out. oh... yeah, uhm... i mean, rachel and i, think you are great... with emma... uhm... we just feel... you! you feel! i... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. i'm sorry. we're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation... oh, no, no, no... that's okay. i got a lot of offers from other families. i just picked you guys because... i liked you the best. oh, damn you geller! anyway, uhm...well, i'm glad there's no hard feelings. no, none at all. you need to be happy with whoever is in your home... although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? maybe it's something i can work on in the future. no, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue. what is it...? please...? you know, i'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you. that's fair... although, can i ask... why do you think that is? why... i... i don't know. uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father? hmmm... i mean, uhm... you know when i was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... you know a-a-and as a kid i wasn't the athlete i am now. huh ha ha! i play squash...! anyway, uhm... i uhm... i always get the feeling he thought i was too sensitive. that must have been hard. it was hard... i remember... i was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... ""what are you doing with those things? what's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy? but you are a real boy! i know i am! ...and when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top? it's allright! crying is good. it lets the boo-hoos out. here come some more... and what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink? what kind? a friend-ship... wow! you blow my mind... oh, i gotta go. aaahh... how much do i owe you? twenty bucks. it's like the cheapest college ever."

i uhm... well, i sang... well actually i rapped... baby got back... you what? you sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses? but you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles. owwwww... please don't take her away from me! oh hi, come on in. i'm catherine, the listing agent. hi i'm joey. this is chandler. so how come richard's selling the place?

i'm not good enough for you? we're not gonna have this conversation again... look at this place. why am i so intimidated by this guy? pretentious art, this huge macho couch. when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing monica to a real man! you don't think he's here, do you? you know what it is? it's a nice place but i gotta see i don't know if i see myself living here. oh, oh, oh, let me see... yeah, i could see it. look at these videos. you know, i mean, who does he think he is? magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke... oh my god! what? there's a tape here with monica's name on it. ooh! a tape with a girls name on it. it's probably a sex tape... wait a minute... this says monica... and this is richard's apartment... get there faster! wow! you look like... like my mom. i'm wearing pantyhose! great! come on in! oh, thank you! oh... oh my god, you're rich! no, my parents are rich. yeah, so... they gotta die someday. hello! mom, dad, this is phoebe. phoebe, these are my parents: theodore and bitsy. theodore... bitsy... what a delight! it's so nice to finally meet you! and you... your home is lovely. well thank you, i'll give you a tour later. it's actually three floors. holy crap! phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?

uhm... okay, well, allright, uhm... originally i'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... i just moved to the city where uhm... i actually lived in a burned out buick lesabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... i got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but i... i got over it and uhm... anyway, now i'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least i don't pay taxes, huh... so... where does everyone summer? god! god! this is not going well. no, no, no, you're doing fine, really... why don't you go talk to my dad? okay, okay, okay, okay... still sure about me being myself? absolutely! or maybe just a little less pimp spit. so theodore... i uhm... i can see where mike gets his good looks from... oh... well... yeah... and that physique! you must work out all the time... oh no, not all the time... i do the best i can... yeah i bet! look out! oh! owwwww! oh my god, are you okay?

are you kidding. he is so considerate of my feelings and... you know i think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover. e-e-excuse me? oh no, no, no, no, no, no. don't get me wrong. no, he's not in like a sissy way. no, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave... that's... my boy. awesome! i'm not gonna watch it... i don't need to watch it... i mean, what good could possibly come from watching? well, we know i'm gonna watch it. hey dude, what's up? don't judge me, i'm only human! did you take that tape? i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... wouldn't you need to know what was on it? i don't know. who'm i'm married to? some girl...!? she hot? yeah...!? how did she get me to settle down? allright, i'm gonna watch it... i mean look, it's probably not even what i think it is... and even if it is... it can't possibly be as bad as what i'm picturing in my head... can it? guess i don't know. my experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... she doesn't say no to much else, i tell ya... then you're gonna have to watch it for me. what? whoo... what? just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is... please? all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame... why am i hearing cheering? well it's okay, its like... its just a football game. football? just football? yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing. it's football... it's just football... this is great! this is the first time i've ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to get a beer... what the... what are you doing? you don't wanna see what i just saw! what are you guys doing? oh my god, is that richard? okay... aahhh... please laugh for mommy... please? please laugh for mommy... not funny huh? oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'cause mommy can rap... my name is mommy and i'm here to say / that all the babies are... oh, i can't rap... allright sweetheart... this is only because i love you so much, and i know that you're not gonna tell anybody... i like... big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... yes! yes! yes! yes! oohhhhh! oh! i like big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can't deny... oh emma you're laughing! oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. oh you beautiful little weirdo... hey! oh you missed it. she was laughing. oh it was amazing. it was amazing. it was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that... oh i know, isn't it? ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh? oh! you know, i just... couple of things i tried ... i just sang a little doo... itsy bitsy spider... you sang baby got back didn't you? nothing else worked. that girl is all about the ass... ...and then it goes back to the chorus... smelly cat, sme-lly ca-t / i-t's not your fau-lt. and that's the end of the song... i realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes. phoebe writes lots of great songs. wha... what was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved? oh, pervert parade? no... oh, ode to a pubic hair? stop! oh god! is that veal? mom, i thought i told you... phoebe's a vegetarian. oh! oh no, no, no, no... that's okay, that's okay... i mean, i'm... i am a vegetarian... except for veal... yeah no, veal i love... phoebe you don't have to eat... no, no, no, i actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... you know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... hmmm... yummy hmmm... so...? what do you think? so you stole that tape from richard's apartment? whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn star! that tape was never meant to be seen by... joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private. monica, look... i don't think you and i have any secrets anymore... not ready to joke about it yet, okay, i see you later. why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it? because that's who i am, okay? i'm sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches. is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache? this is about you and richard. he's clearly not over you. he keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants. isn't that sad? i mean, can you see how pathetic that is? you shouldn't be jealous. you should feel bad for him. oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a moustache! chandler, this is not our problem. we've got each other. that's all that matters. yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air... cowboy boots? i've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! oh, good, good. play more, 'cause i wanna see how it ends. that's not me! what...? that's not you! life is good again! ride 'em cowgirl! that bastard taped over me! is that a problem? i-it's just so insulting! big spring for a new blank tape, doctor! i can't imagine what he sees in her. she actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his. oh, hello dear... hey, what's going on? we were just chit-chatting. how's your friend? a little better. by the way, do you know who's moving back into town? tom and sue's daughter jen. you remember her michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single. i'm not interested. oh, please darling, let's be honest. you can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real... all right, stop! you know, all phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. and maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. and yeah... she's a little different than you are... michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! so what? i mean if even i can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. and you don't have to like her. you just have to accept the fact that i do. i mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman i love... the woman you what? yeah... the woman you what? the woman i love... i love you... which is probably something i shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and tom and sue...who are by the way the most sinfully boring i've ever met in my life... i love you too... you do?

what happened? my boyfriend canceled on me. i mean.. i i finally find a real relationship. i mean, someone that i can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. i swear, its almost not worth dating married guys. don't say that. oh. i was so looking forward to this. it was going to be such a beautiful thanksgiving. we were going to have sushi. oh amy, don't cry amy. um.. ross, could i talk to you in private? sure, you want to go upstairs?  um look i was thinking.. if its ok with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving. you know, i think thats a great idea. it'll be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis. look i know she's a little tough to take. she has no where else to go, and she's my sister. alright, she's emma's aunt. and i would like them to bond. ok, fine, but i don't want them bonding to much. i don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job. ross, you know what? she may need one..we're just going to have to make our peace with that!  monica and chandler's apartment hi. hi, hey. hey you guys, this is my sister amy. this is chandler, joey, phoebe and you know mon. hi. oh my god. you're on days of our lives. yeah. wow. they must put a lot of makeup on you. hap.. hap.. happy thanksgiving.  hi. hi.  hey you. so. welcome. is this your first time you're seeing emma? yeah i.. i think so. it's nice to meet you emma. phoe-be. oh. that's a funny noise.  pheebs, i still need some help here oh right, ok um. ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . for example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying. oh.. i don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. i mean lying is basically just acting and i am a terrfic actor. you are a terrific actor.  hey. hey where's the baby? oh we just put her down for a nap. oh i was just thinking. you know what would be incredible? if you guys died. thank you amy. no, no, then i would get the baby. i mean you know it would be just like a movie. like at first i wouldn't know what to do with her, then i would rise to the occasion and and then i would get a makeover and then i'd get married. thats a great movie.  now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. i was thinking about changing her name. i'm just not really a big fan of emily. emma. emma, ross wants you. phoe-be. why does she keep making that noise? honey, i don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby. well who would? well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want monica and chandler. i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma. yeah oh my god, i'm so moved. i don't believe this, hold on a second. you guys die and i don't get your baby? see look amy, we're a lot closer to monica and chandler. we see them every day. and truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby. connected? i mean.. to what? she's.. she's a lump. you know, guys i got to say. this means so much to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... this guy? seriously? later in the day. okay! it's time for dinner. everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful. woah. woah... woah. okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt. hey! how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? do you not trust me with a fancy plate? no, honey, its. thats a special plate. see its a game, whoever gets that plate wins. i can't believe i won. its such a slap in the face. i'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me. monica is ross' sister. no, ross' sister was really fat. that was me. no, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog. hey. amy. you've got to stop doing that.  okay, listen i know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. i mean, i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this.  now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun. okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do i get the baby? no, if crazy plate lad.. if monica dies then i would get emma, right?  well actually... actually what? well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. emma would go to my parents. what? hurts, doesn't it?  uh.. who has to die for me to get her?  so if monica's not around, then i'm not good enough to raise emma? no, that that is not what we're saying. yeah he's lying. he looked down.  well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think you're going to be a wonderful parent. it's just.. you're more the fun parent. yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict. thats not how you see me, is it? no you're all about the fun. look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think i'm not capable? no, you both are equally capable. its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together. ok. so if we both had emma and i die she'd have to give her up. sure, monica would have to give her up. i lie better then that, right? so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me? there's your movie! monica opens her front door. chandler is sitting in the hallway. hey. there you are. you disappeared after dinner. oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly? ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about. i mean its not like their so responsible. emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom. yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong father figure and i never will be. no you learn these things. you grow into it. yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody knows it. i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts. oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""go to your room! you're grounded""? can you hear me say ""you're grounded""? you said that to me last week. how hard is it? no shoes on the furniture. back to monica and chandler's apartment. amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad. the producer from days left a message on my machine asking why i wasn't at the parade. they said everybody's pissed off at me.. and they all got to meet santa! it's ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. you weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency. oh, i like that, yeah. wasn't at the parade because i had a family emergency. ooh, what happened? oh.. my sister's raccoon. no! nothing with a raccoon. arg... alright, i'll take care of it. monica and chandler come through the front door. oh wait.. what are you doing? setting the table. yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too. oh how nice. maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrier. he goes to chandler. hey dude, you okay? sorry about before. oh no thats okay, you're totally right. i don't know anything about disciplining a child. but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that when i die, you don't get joey. ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. ucch. uchh in case you hadn't noticed, i'm not talking to you. uchh! you know.. this.. this is classic rachel. yeah.. yeah right.. remember in high school when i died and didn't give you my baby? this might be my one chance to have a baby rachel. i mean, you know that i have been so busy focusing on my carrer. what? what carrer? um.. i'm a decorator. ok. you decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. okay! i went to the zoo yesterday and now i'm a koala bear. why can't you ever be supportive? sup.. you want to talk supportive? you didn't even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby. oh. yeah. well.. you didn't come see me when i was in the hospital when i was getting my lips done. i did the first time! oh. oh.. and you know what. you want to know why i'm not giving emily to you. emma. oh whose side are you on? i'm not giving you emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child. how hard could it be? you do it. ooh oooh.. do you want to know why you don't want me to have the baby? uh huh. because you don't want me to be happy. you.. you have always been jealous of me. jealous of what? of your lack of responsiblity? you, your immaturity? your total disregard of other people's feelings? uh.. to name a few. you know.. you know.. you've just always been like this. you just have to have everything. and i couldn't have anything. like in junior high, when you stole timmy from me. i mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me? timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him! oh come on, that was 20 years ago. get over it. i cannot, i cannot believe that i invited you here today. yeah, well you know what i cannot believe. that my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from ralph lauren and i still have to pay retail. ah ha ha. ah ha ha. it's forty five. you bitch. you just think you're so perfect. with your new baby and your, your small apartment. well let me tell you something. your baby isn't even that cute.  too far, amy. too far. you take that back. no. take it back! no! what are you going to do? make me? heey man, i work out.  so do i. i do pilates. i do yoga. bring it on!  put the plates in the boxes!! put the plates in the boxes! did you just push me? uh, yeah i think i did. alright. thats it! forget the bubblewrap! there isn't time!  frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!  oh my god! shouldn't we stop this? what? are you out of your mind? lets throw some jello on them.  ew! gross.   alright! that is it. this is our apartment and you can not behave this way. now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out, but they're very important to monica. i want you to apologize to her right now. i'm sorry. mon, i'm so sorry. okay. thats better. now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it. sorry. by the way, that fight was totally arousing. dude. well done. you know what? if i die, and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma. oh yeah? well thanks. so, so now do i get joey? okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.  are you okay mon? uh huh.. i mean these things happen. its' just a plate. its not like somebody died. it's all right. you can mourn. thank you. it was so beautiful. i'm going to go to joeys and get the pies. actually its not pies, its just pie. i don't care. oh my god. i've lost the will to scold. look amy, it got a little of control..um.. and i'm sorry. you're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.. so you're going to give me the baby? uh. no.. i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount. you are not going to regret this.  she needs changing. oh no no no.. i'll get her. i'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma. i'll be right there emma. just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. well.. what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first. hey, does monica know about her broken plates yet? nope... broke them all, huh? yep... you gonna tell her? nope... hey... so i'm gonna... put the plates back. you know, i think you were right, i don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time. like only if the queen comes? maybe not even then. hey! i did it. i called my producer. i told him i had a family emergency, he totally bought it. thanks for teaching me how to lie pheebs. no problem! next week: stealing... bye plates! oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? what? something happened with the plates? uhm... yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in..."

""really sexy. could i be any more turned on?"" okay. whoa, whoa. why are there two glasses of wine out? because... one of them is for you. cheers. okay, buh-bye. you know, it's funny. i've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself. hi ya. you might want to keep practicing. yah. it's joey. hey joe. dude, come home! what? why? come ... home. look i, i can't. what's going on? i don't know how to tell you this but, uh ... i think monica's cheatin' on ya. i told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you. all right look. if you can't come home and deal with this, then i'm gonna. no! i just heard him! can you ... hear him ... now? no. all right, i'm going in. no! wait! i heard him again! all right, look. just stay there. i'm coming home. okay. great. i'll see you when you get here. i'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out. is that really necessary? absolutely. you'd do it for me. not that you ever have to because i know how to keep my women satisfied. shouldn't the pizza be here by now? i mean, they said thirty minutes or less. well, how long has it been? eleven minutes. and now twelve. so, do you like the beer? i do. i do. although, it's actually a lager. huh. what's the difference between beer and lager? i don't know. we could look it up. things are about to get wild. oh god. remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and ross? oh god. it seems like forever ago. i know. so, what's going on with you and ross? well, um ... i don't know. i mean, for a long time nothing. but you know, actually right before you picked me up, ross and i had a ... ah ... little thing. oh my god! i love things. what happened? well, um, first he told me he liked how i looked. and, ah, then we had a little ... um ... eye-contact. eye-contact? mm-hmm. i hope you were using protection. excuse me. um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar. oh. should we send them something back? oooh. let's do. let's send them mashed potatoes. no! wait! no, no. don't do that! that's going to make them think they can come over here. so? what if they do? well, we're not here to meet guys. you have a boyfriend, i have a b... baby and a ross. yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. we're just having fun. you know, not everything had to go as far as ""eye-contact."" chandler, you have to tell joey that you're not in tulsa. don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that i'm cheating on him? i heard it. i don't want him to think that i'm having an affair. all right. i've got a plan. i'll go down the fire escape. yes, because all good plans start with, ""i'll go down the fire escape."" hear me out woman. i'll go down the fire escape. then, i'll wait for a while. then, when i come up the stairs, it'll be just like i just got back from tulsa. then, joey and i will come in and see that there's no guy in here. aren't you afraid that joey's going to figure all of this out? i heard it. i'm just going to wait for a little while. scary pigeon's back? it's huge. oh my god. i can't believe you live in that building. my grandmother lives in that building. ida green? no sense of personal space? kind of smells like chicken? looks like a potato.

what? this doesn't feel weird! i know. you're a really good kisser. well, i have kissed over four women. do you wanna get under the covers? hm-hmm! okay! wow! you are really fast! it bodes well for me that speed impresses you. we're gonna see each other naked. yep! do you wanna do it at the same time? count of three? one! two! two! three! well i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined. eh, we weren't that close anyway! eh! so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man? well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not just goof around with him. y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this. i think you're better than you think you are. really? okay, so... know when to stop. y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay? yeah. don't do the dance. right! i can't get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! okay, here's something, here's something blue and new. you're so efficient. i love you! let's go! no-no-no, wait! we need something old! oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was twelve. that'll work! i don't think so. okay, now we just need something borrowed! here just...take this. that's stealing! no, we'll-we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress. ohh. okay, one thing at a time. listen umm, i've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that. ehh. eh, you work for that. look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding. you do?! yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do. oh, you're so sweet. oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff? eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college. you thought about that? yeah. how many kids were we gonna have? uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy. what else did you think about? well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old. y'know what? i-i don't want a big, fancy wedding. sure you do. no, i want everything that you just said. i want a marriage. you sure? uh-hmm. i love you so much. i love you. oohh, i love it! really? you're not gonna return it?

""oh gavin, please, please look at my ass"". stop looking at my ass! i mean, i just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? this is a work environment, she's your subordinate. i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag. that is totally different for two reasons. one - i didn't know that you knew that. and two, i wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship. huh. what's tag's last name? it was ... oh my god. he didn't have a last name. it was just ""tag"". you know, like cher, or, you know, moses. but it was a deap meaningful relationship. oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. you are arrogant, you are pompous ... morgan! morgan! tag's last name was morgan! huh! it was jones. yeah well what are you, his boyfriend? man, i wish i had a nanny like you. you mean, when you were a baby. sure. would you stop staring at her? i wasn't staring. i was leering. what's the big deal with her? maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way. yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. you know, when it's right there in your face. me, i like to have to work to find someone attractive. makes me feel like i earned it. looks like joey is doing allright with her. yeah. hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once. i'm gonna take her back to the appartment. ok, i'll be home right after work. ok, by emma-wemma-demma, i love you - wovyou dovyou ... bye they've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good. i think it's sweet. bye, emma-wemma-demma. hey, listen, joey, about molly, i really prefer if you didn't go after her. why not? because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away. so, what, you think i'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? yeah, sounds about right. come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? just - just forget about her, ok? just, she's off limits. oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? now that you told me i can't have it makes me want her even more! what are you, a child?

bob! robert! oh wait, i think i hear him. oh - oh my god! bob had babies! bob's a mom! better think of a new name for him. i don't know, i kinda like bob for a girl. i don't know, i mean i'm not sure ... oh my god, we killed bob! maybe it wasn't bob, maybe it was a mouse. suzie? whazzup?? seriously dude, 3 years ago. listen, can you do me a favor? i'm gonna be out today. can you just keep an eye on joey, make sure nothing happens between him and molly? you don't trust him? wh - no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"". is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? because i could get a job any day now. you do appear right on the cusp of something. come on man, i'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me? allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it. well we gotta do something, ok? nannies like her don't grow on trees. picturing that tree? i am, yes. where you going, joe? for a walk. oh. you mind if i join you? actually, that will be long. you know, i really need to organize my thoughts. your thoughts?

honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over. she's out, i'm gonna take her home. oh, ok, thank you. do you see what all the guys see in her? wouldn't kick her out of bed. no more vodka for me! hey rach, so can i sing happy birthday to you now? yeah, sure! oh ... happy birth ... oh, see you later hey rach, somebody got you shoes! oh, give me! be careful, be careful! these are my rat babies! yeah. we have rat babies now. ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party? so this is what a stroke feels like. i had to bring them! we killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. you know, they require constant care. you should know that, rachel, you're a mother. are you comparing my daughter to a rat? no! seven rats! i think we should take them home, we need feed them. whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats? well i'm sorry rachel, but i'm not like you, ok? not everyone can afford help. where the hell are joey and molly? i asked you to watch them. i'm sorry, i got a little occupied. we have to stop them before something happens! right behind you, big guy! so you see, molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. it takes a lot of hard work. so where did you study? oh, i didn't go to college. no, where did you study acting? molly ... people don't study acting ... molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute? sure, i'll go check on emma. thanx. will the stable boy never get the princess?? what do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch? no ... the leather sticks to my ass. you know, this isn't fair. what makes you think that i'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? huh? can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her, and might want something real? look, the truth is, i haven't felt this way about anyone since rachel, ok? i didn't think i could ever love again. come on! joe! ok hi, is molly here? yeah, come on in. molly? hey! guys, this is tabatha . i'll see you tomorrow. ok ... well, uh, joey, i guess we have no problem. it's like my favorite fairy tale come true! the princess, the stable boy and the lesbian! ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed. hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats? well, you know what, they're our responsibility now. ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. what happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them? mate? they're all brothers and sisters. yeah - not such a problem with rats. no, they're more of a ""love the one you're with"" kind of animals. no. wh - get off your sister! oh my god, what are we gonna do? we have 7 rats. so what if each of them has 7 rats? and then each of those have 7 rats? that's like ... that's math i can't even do! what are we gonna do? well, i know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives. yeah, ok. i guess you're right. allright, so we should just give them away. but to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. they're bob's favorites. it's gonna be ok. you must think i'm crazy. no, i think you're sweet. good. it's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. i guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when i gave birth to my brother's triplets and i had to give them up. i haven't told you about that yet, have i? hey! hi. thanks for the party, honey. should i help you clean up? no way! you had your party, now i have mine! is everything alright? yeah, i just get a little bummed when my birthday's over. well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. that jerk gavin from your office didn't show up . mmm hmm. yeah, hey. oh, we weren't talking about you. no, no way to recover. no. nice party. well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? god! oh, this party was lame ... again, you're welcome. look, i'll just give you this and go. oh, you bought me a present! why? well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. there are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. ok, i ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier. aww. well, ok, well that's very nice. and you wrote a card . ""from gavin"" i really mean it. awww, awww, it's beautiful. you don't mind? well, what do you know, it fits! see, gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. why did you give me such a hard time? i'm not sure. well monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me. i do have feelings for you. you do? yes, i feel that you are a little annoying. see? why, gavin, why? right when i'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ... first i was afraid, i was petrified hey hi listen, i think i've left something here. oh, well someone left this . this is yours? no, but i like it. i think i left one of my rat babies. oh, uh, well, i haven't seem it but if i do i'll let you know. ohmygod! rat baby! rat baby! rat baby! ooh, maybe that's him!"
9.0,14.0,The Blind Dates,"morning, roomie! hey! you remembered to put clothes on this morning. fifth day's a charm. oh, joey, it's so great to be back here. i gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and emma. hey, it's great having you back. you know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night? hey, you're not naked! so hey, rach, when will we expect to see you tonight? well, i'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. but she did actually fall back to sleep, so... she's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night. bye! bye! hey, i hope emma isn't making it too hard on you. no, hey, it's been great. yeah? yeah. and look, i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? and even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump... yeah, that'll do it. wow! so, how are you? i'm, i'm okay. really? sure, i mean, do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out? of course. you know, i'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce. well, actually it... no, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! anyway, i think rachel and i need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people. wow, really? yeah, sure, why not? in fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me... sure, i know lots of girls. yeah? any names come to mind? ooh, names? hey. hey. i was just gonna get something to eat. you want something? what you got? okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... ooh! strained plums. we haven't tried that yet. goodie! thanks. so, how is it living with rachel again? i mean, apart from the great food. i'm fine, i'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and ross. you know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody. oh my god, rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too. why are they doing this? i don't know. they're so perfect for each other; it's crazy. you know what's crazy? these jars. what is it, like two bites in here? i just wish they'd realise they should be together. i know, i know. and when they moved back in together, i figured y'know, that's where things were headed. i know. they should be a family. they should get married and have more children. yes, and they should name one of their kids joey. i may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name. you know what? maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other. yeah, because it is slim pickings. i had this date last night: yuck! but we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom. so, what are we gonna do? are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people? i know; that just pushes them further and further apart. yeah. oh, i know what we can do. we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together. ooh, that's a great plan! yeah, you know what the best part of it is? i get to do my ""plan-laugh."" shhh! not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh... hey! hey! you guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you? see, now, why would you assume that? just because we're married? i will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. now, if you'll excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries. i was just asking 'cause i need someone to watch emma tonight. sure, we'll do that. what are you up to? well, phoebe set me up on a date. oh my god. wow. why? what's the big deal? just figured, 'cause you and ross are... what, slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, i'm all set. well, i think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? i mean, it sounds healthy. i mean, you have needs. embrace your womanhood! you want a job? turn off ""oprah,"" and send out a resume! so i'll bring her by around seven? is that okay? oh, it's perfect. oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! she's at such a cute age. oh, a couple things. now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. and watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. and oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... thanks, you guys. have fun! suddenly i wish i was reading my own name. ooh, joey. hey. hey. i'm so excited; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight. all right! who is he? well, it's this guy i used to massage. and by massage, i mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me. okay, okay. wait till you hear who i got for ross. oh, yeah. she's this really boring woman. she's a teacher! a teacher? yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... and oh, oh, she loves puzzles. huh? come on, who loves puzzles? well, ross does. what... you're - you're ruining the plan! joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! oh my god, you're right! yeah. she even reads for pleasure! how do you even know a woman like that? what? i'm not allowed to know smart women? joey. i met her at the library. i went in to pee. so now what do we do? well, okay, i'll - i'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else. what if we don't find him somebody else? we'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up! ooh...i hear that's bad. ooh, so this is great! rachel's gonna have a terrible date, ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together. ah, yes, the plan! it's not santa's plan. no, it's... yeah, you know, it's not that fun. no, i think we killed it. emma? emma? look at me! well, i think i'll go downstairs for a while. no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no! it's okay, it's okay. i didn't go. don't cry, it's just a bit! i'm your uncle chandler; funny is all i have! okay, just so you know, i'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours. i don't do that. i'll try to stop. wait, did you say until the sixth? yeah. today is the sixth. no, it's not. yes, it's also 2003. oh my god. today's the sixth?! i may be done ovulating! i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant. it's okay. go take the test and see if we're okay. okay. tough crib. hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? there's only one here. i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times. chandler! i am not working. there's not much to do around here! excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle? uh, there's a drunk chinese guy. well, if i'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me. can i get you another glass of wine? nah, i don't know if i should. i don't wanna be drunk when i go home alone. got stood up, huh? yeah, it's no big deal. it's just a blind date. are you worried your date came, saw you, and left? no! we're okay. i'm still ovulating. oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, i am not. so, let's do this. i - i don't think i can. come on. i know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute. because of emma. oh my god, emma. oh, sweetie, i forgot you were here. oh, you're right, we can't do this. we can't leave her alone. sorry. unless... maybe we do it here. i mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age? well, she's aware when we leave the room. she may notice if we start... canoodling in it. canoodling? well, i can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the b-a-b-y. i don't know. i mean, i guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so... horrifying? scarring? something people go to jail for? i guess you're right. you guess i'm right? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window. but what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer? wow, everything looks so good! i think i'm gonna have the chicken. i - i just have to say this; you're really beautiful. oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. thank you. i'm kind of funny looking. what? oh, come on, you're way out of my league. everybody in here knows it. bet that guy over there's probably saying, ""ooh, why she out with him? he must be rich!"" well, i'm not! so, what do think you wanna order? i'm really excited about that chicken. i'm not funny either. so, if you were thinking, ""well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs""... that ain't gonna happen. well, come on, steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. hey, now wait a minute. phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. that's impressive. i lost it. to drugs. i silk-screen t-shirts now. really? what's that like? it's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. that's right. i have no money, i'm not funny, i live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and i'm pretty sure i'm infertile. now, come on, come on, steve. there must be something that you like about yourself. i do like my hair. really? hello? phoebe, it's me. i'm going to hunt you down and kill you! hey, rach! this is the worst date ever. how could you set me up with this creep? you know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. i don't care! this guy is a nightmare! oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned. he's not stoned. did he go out for a cigarette? yeah, four times. my dear, sweet rach. well, our plan is working. rachel is having a miserable time, and ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone. oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together. by the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny mexico. oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan. she's asleep. chandler? what are you doing? emma was doing it! she's asleep. ooh, she's asleep, that means we can... yes, but we have to be fast. okay, i'll try. and you can't make any noise. okay, i'll try. hello? emma? hey! hi! how are ya? how are ya? where are your babysitters, huh? why's the bedroom door closed? you can't have s-e-x, when you're taking care of the b-a-b-i-e! i've got bad news. the chinese guy left. eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be. look; you got stood up, who cares? we're gonna show you a good time. just sit and relax. in fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house. wow, free crab cakes. well, that's nice. although i was hoping to have sex tonight. ooh... just the crab cakes. what are you doing? are you trying to get him to stay? because you can't do that. just get out of here, okay? what's - what's going on? eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. we have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home. what? you - you're making money off my misery? well, if you stay till 9:20, i am. this is unbelievable. i - i have never been so insulted in my life. now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, i'll be on my way. well, that was weird. you were loud, and i was fast. i think we may have really done it this time. oh, i wish i didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test. you may wanna get some more of those too. where's emma? oh my god, where's emma? where's emma? don't ask me, i was in there canoodling you! okay, okay, i'm sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma. you go look across the hall, and i'll call her cell. okay. hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to rachel. i - i can't believe im crying in front of you. you must think i'm so pathetic. no, no, no, i admire a man who can cry. really? don't touch my coat! oh, sorry, it's my phone. hello? hey, rach, how's it going? oh my god, this is the worst date ever! look, you know what, i'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? what's up? hey, did you stop by here? no. oh my god, then... oh, thank god! emma, there you are! what? what do you mean, ""there you are""? where was she? oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" she just she loves it when i'm dramatic. why the hell did you take her? because you two were having sex! no, we weren't! don't you lie to me! i could tell by chandler's hair. you are so lazy. can't you get on top for once? all right, all right, we were. we were trying to make a baby. monica's ovulating. hey! it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room. i'm gonna have to tell rachel about this. no, no, no. no, please don't. please, joey. she will kill us! hey, i gotta! unless... unless what? unless you name your firstborn child joey. what? why? hey, i may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name. your family name is tribbiani. you almost had me. well, uh... look, i think i know the answer to this question, but... would you like to make love to me? really, really not. eh, it's just as well. doesn't work anyway. all right, well that's good to know. good night, steve. hey, what's wrong? i just had a rough night. oh. crab cake? eww! well, what happened? oh, well, i...it's kind of weird talking to you about this, but... monica told me you had a blind date. yeah. i did, too. oh. but is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up? oh, oh no. do you think she walked in, saw you and left? why does everyone keep saying that? well, if it makes you feel any better, i wish my date hadn't shown up. that bad? well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this. female body inspector? what size is that? now, wait a minute. so, they're gonna name their first child joey? uh-huh. how - how do i get them to name the next one after me? it's easy, you just walk in on them having sex. oh, so they owe me like, three phoebes. oh my god! look, it's ross and rachel. oh, the plan is working. don't, don't do the plan-laugh. the first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters. oh. huh. you know, it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn't even show. wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? i mean, that's just stupid. we're geniuses! yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding. oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again. oh, they see us! oh, they, they look mad. oh, they figured it out. they're coming this way. run! where? mexico! can you believe they're still not here? i know. a double blind date, and we both get stood up. what are the chances? i know, i'm so bummed. can we have our free crab cakes now? what? we've been stood up. and we want our free crab cakes. guys, give it a rest. nobody's betting on you tonight. although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry. i have such fat hands!"

ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time. well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and i think i heard somebody say ""slorps"". and here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! would you help me try to sell these?

well, ross was mugged as a kid. you were? yeah, it was pretty traumatic. i was outside st. marc's comics you know, i-i-i was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week- wonderwoman! anyway, i was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: ""gimme your money, punk!"" oh my god i know! and-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book: ""science boy"" oh yeah! what was his superpower again? a superhuman thirst for knowledge. that's it. well, i-i better get to class are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way, phoebe? no actually, you might wanna stay away from jane street that's where stabby joe works. okay, i think we have a problem here. what? well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, i, uhm, i worked st. marc's comics. yeah? well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. so? well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- ""geology rocks!"" oh my god! i know i mugged ross! you're late! i know, i'm sorry, but can i just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?

""i need an answer!"" ""i-i-i can't tell you somethin' i don't know."" ""you know!"" ""i don't know!"" ""i need an answer now!"" ""alright, here, you want an answer the answer is"" oh! ""she never loved me, she only loved you.""

9.0,16.0,The Boob Job,"r3v3lat1on with corrections and additional information by keith owen did you see our bank statement? can this be right? i know...god. i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos. what happened to all our money? i'm not sure what they did, but i'm inclined to blame enron. i guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in. maybe i should quit and get a job that pays. oh, but you're finally doing something that you love! i can't ask you to give that up. though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold. you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change. you're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer? ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents. no! we're not borrowing money. why not? because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money. wow! i had no idea you had this much pride. that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard. i'm gonna go. why?? i haven't been home in a couple of days and i need to get some more clothes. oh...you don't have to go, i have something that will fit you. i put that tube top on as a joke. i want you to stay. i want to stay too but i've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as i can.. why don't you turn them inside ou... done it. i'll be back in a couple of hours. i'll miss you. me too. you know what? i just realised something. i don't wanna go home. great! ok...i'll go get the tube top. no, no! what i mean is, i hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because i live above a known crack den but... mostly because when i'm there, it's just, i really miss you. so.. do you want to move in together? wow, mike hannigan...you sure know how to make a girl say ""hell yeah!"" so we're doing it? yeah! let's do it! let's live together! oh god, we're really going to move in together! yeah! i've always wanted to live with a guy. ""pick up your socks!"" ""put down the toilet seat!"" ""no! we're not having sex anymore!"" it's gonna be fun! hey joey! hey! listen...i need to know that what i'm about to ask you, will never get back to chandler. i'd be lying if i said i haven't thought about it myself. chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. good......but wrong. ok first of all...it would be great. but that's not what i'm here to talk to you about. i need to borrow some money. aww, i don't know monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake. but chandler lent you money! and i think he would tell you it was a mistake. come on...i just need it for some rent and..and some other bills. oh...how much? two thousand dollars? two thousand dollars!? what do you think i am? i soap opera star!? yeah... that's right i am! hi you guys! hey! oo...what's in the bag? oh er... well you know emma started crawling? i realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment. oh...baby-proofing... why is this such a big deal now? y'know, when i was a kid it was like.. ""whoops! joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""whoops! joey electrocuted himself again!"" huh! anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff? no. i was just going to do this myself. you're gonna do it? yeah, why? you don't think a woman can do this? oh, women can. you can't. monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig? you're a pig. and you can't do this. wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself! the hardware store is right down the street. there is a hardware store right down the street? hey you guys! ok, we've got great news. phoebe and i are moving in together. congratulations!/good for you!/great! i know it's so exciting! you know i've never lived with a guy before. well you know it's just like living with a girl. only they don't steal your makeup. unless they're playing ""this is what my sister would look like"" yeah.... she's not so cute. i'm gonna go to the bathroom. okay, well you put down the toilet seat. yes dear. is that a bit you guys do? uh huh...we're playing you two. we don't do that! tell her we don't do that! yes dear. i can't believe you guys are moving in together. that's, that's great! i mean...i'm happy for you guys.. i hear wedding bells. monica slow down! ok? i'm just excited to be living with him. you know i mean, i don't know, can i see someday being married to mike? sure! yeah. y'know..i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. but do i want that house in connecticut...you know..near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior.. oh my god i do. phoebe, i had no idea you were so conventional. i know! i guess i am! oh my god! load up the volvo i want to be a soccer mom! you ready to go? yeah! you bet roomy! don't you mean..groomy? what are you talking about? oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. china patterns!!!!! this is easy...can't do this! oh! wow! seriously i can't do this. hey joe! hey! listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica anything about it. i thought you didn't have secrets from monica. and that would have made the official party line. monica and i are having a little financial trouble. yeah, i know. what? what do you mean you know? err... i just figured it out! you know, i mean you're not working and the economy is bad. oh! right. that's the fastest i have ever thought! anyway, err... i need to borrow some money. oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars? yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that! err...well i...know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is. oh ok. i am on fire! listen...this is really nice. do you... did you write a cheque to monica for two thousand dollars? did monica borrow money from you? err... kind of. i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems? oh no no no no no... it wasn't... it wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her. what? something personal. what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about? excuse me. boob job. i don't want her to get a boob job! that's crazy! well it's...it's not that crazy okay? making them smaller, that would be crazy. well hey, i wanna ask you about monica's little ""groomy"" joke. oh! alright. well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy. i get the joke. sophisticated as it was. now the thing i wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right? oh no! no no! not at all. we're just moving in right now. see where it goes. yeah well, that's the thing. for me it's as far as it can ever go. what do you mean? look. phoebe, i-i love you. very much. but i never want to get married again. oh. wow. it's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. i kind of lost faith in the whole idea. was it really that bad? at one point near the end she deliberately defecated..... ok, well that's bad. but don't you think it might be different with someone else? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. except for once in the ocean. look it's not about who i would marry. and i was certain the first time i got married it would last forever. and i was totally wrong! but it's just... look phoebe, it's not about you. i just never wanna get married again. oh! i'm sorry. are you ok with that? cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea. no! i definitely don't wanna get married. no i just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. whew! coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister! trust me, i will never... yeah i get that. hi! so you gave in and decided to call someone? yeah, i don't know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks. you're all set. oh thank you so much. oh oh wait! you forgot your erm...your game. thanks..... hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife. don't look at me i never get his jokes. thank you?

the other hugsy, i don't know, i guess i'll just take it back. oh you know what? when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton. oh i loved her so much, i took her everywhere, i would braid her tail... make the transfer! should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can't find it? oh, no don't worry about that, i swallowed that years ago. oh, i don't think she likes the new hugsy. but he's the same. yeah, i think she wants the old one back. but he's the same. joey, come on! he's the same! you're not the same! haha! you know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after i've buzzed you into the building. so phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door. those are my shoes. oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping. monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me, but i'm actually feeling a lot better. yeah, i just kinda want to be alone right now. who's that? i ordered chinese food. what are the chances? 1 billion chinese people and they send mike!? what are you doing here? phoebe called me. phoebe! i'm sorry, i broke down... i wanted to see him. damnit phoebe! how did you even call him? there is a speakerphone on the base unit... base unit! think monica! think! look, if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see... this doesn't concern you!! oh! sorry, i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name! look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder. not if nothing happens. why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends? sure! if you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe i'll join ya. you know, i'm your friend and mike's friend . sit down. oh wow wow wow!! make room for your friend! so how've you been? i've been pretty good! you look really beautiful. thanks, you look good too. oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. keep it clean! so how's the piano playing going? actually i've been playing a lot of love songs lately. i've missed you. i've missed you too. you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up. and then a pigeon ate it! hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me? uhu uhu, check this out. huh! so that's what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you're not actually going to send these out are ya? eh..actually no, i don't need to because your little ""ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead. oh my god! nobody cares that i'm dead!? no, come on, you know that's not true. what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! i didn't get one response! and i'm dead! well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community. i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried that guy! alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief. you're right. there isn't a decent outlet. right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come. exactly!! ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? you're having a memorial service for yourself!? no! that would be stupid! you're having it for me! ross, don't press send, don't press se... ! oh, too late, too late! it's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... i'm trying to put emma down for a nap, have you seen hugsy? original or crappy? original. no, sorry haven't seen him. then what's that big lump under your covers? it's monica, ok? that's not monica! alright!! fine! it's original hugsy! no, now i know that emma wants him but he's mine and i need him.. oh god. ... she's being unreasonable! joey, there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much oh don't cover its ears! it's because it reminds her of her uncle joey! it does? yeah! and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much. really? she... she loves me? oh yeah! but you know what? if you need hugsy, don't worry. emma will totally understand. i won't... but whatever . ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, i mean rach, i mean if if... . if hugsy means that much to emma then... well she can have him. oooh... you're sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up. look emma, look who's baaack! look forget it forget it... i can't do it. are you gonna... you're going to take hugsy away from a little child? how do you think i got him in the first place? alright you two, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. now i don't want anything going on while i'm gone. here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it. i've missed you so much! no, i'm not gonna ask you to get back together because i know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night. i know, i want that too, but is that going to make it too hard? it can't be any harder than this... i mean, if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time, i... i would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the last time... i never would have stopped. kiss him, you fool!! what? didn't you hear that speech? if you don't kiss him then i will! oh, i missed you so much! i knew you'd be here! oh, crap! who is this? my friend manny. i asked him to keep me away from you. hi, that's what i'm doing for phoebe! well, you are not doing a very good job! excuse me? what's with the kissing? hey, at least i knew where my guy was. oh yeah yeah, thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing! you didn't hear the speech! i've heard the speech: ""if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... "" hey, it was very moving! you're just heartless! you're weak! you're... weird! your pants are undone! oh ! where did they go? damn it! oh we blew it. i blame myself. and i blame you too. it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i tell you, when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted! there you go! someone came! ok, ok! i'm gonna go hide! oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! hi, glad you could come. please, come in. hi, you're chandler bing, right? i'm tom gordon, i was in your class. oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat. thanks... uh... i'm so sorry about ross, it's... at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps who is he? some guy, tom gordon. i don't remember him, but then again i touched so many lives. so, did you know ross well? oh, actually i barely knew him. yeah, i came because i heard chandler's news. d'you know if he's seeing anyone? yes, he is. me. what? you... you... oh! can i ask you a personal question? ho-how do you shave your beard so close? ok tommy, that's enough mourning for you! here we go, bye bye!! hey, listen. call me. ok! i'm dead and no one cares? i look like a man?? please, one ridiculous problem at a time! it isn't ridiculous, look around! no one's here! you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand! yes, you're right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i didn't have an impact on anyone? oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something? yeah... i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide. hi. i'm here for ross geller's memorial service. kori? kori weston? yeah... wow! you look amazing! and you are... chandler, chandler bing. i'm not gay, i'm not gay at all. you are married though. don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! i can't believe that ross is gone. it is just so sad. i didn't know ross and you were so close. we weren't but we had one class together. he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. i always remembered him. i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently. i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. i guess i really missed my chance. but you didn't! i'm still alive!! kori, i know this is a big surprise for you. it's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! i mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people! you sick freak, who does that? i can't believe i had a crush on you! did you hear that? kori weston had a crush on me!! no mum, i'm not dead. i know it's not something to kid about. it was just a practical joke between chandler and me, but it's over, ok? actually no, even if i had died, you would not be left childless. monica?"

hello? hey charlie, what do you know? what's going on? chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. but out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three. ooh! tough odds! yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery! look who's coming around! damnit. alright call me when you know more. did you get it?

guys! give someone else a chance! alright, who wants to do it? oh can i? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. it's really not fair either! you know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses! ok, hey rach? oh no, i'm good, i don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands. i'll do it!! it'll get the casserole stink off of mine. i hope i win! well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right? i can't tell you what i'm wishing for! else...you know...won't come true! right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for! can't really say! i understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you? i'm not really comfortable with these questions! please, just do it! one, two, three! i won, hey! you know what, i'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! ah!! that thing gets hot!! you know, ross, just keep making your jokes. how are you gonna feel if we actually do win? uh, you're not gonna win. oh, i know, i know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! and then how you gonna feel? you know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, i can't guys, i'll meet you guys up there, i gotta gas up the hyundai"" ok, i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that. i can see the headline now: ""lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm"". why would i eat my own arm? well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want. you know what, ross? i'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you. why? because i know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. and you're my brother, and i want you to be a part of this. you don't have to do that, i'll pay for myself. but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! come here get a room! ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win? i don't know, probably just invest it. ooh! calm down ... seriously, that's your fantasy? to invest it? oh, i'm sorry, did i say ""invest it""? i meant ""be cool and piss it all away"" ooh, ooh, i know! we should pool all own money and buy the knicks! i don't really care about the knicks. oh, you will when i pick you as starting forward. you would do that? i never get picked! you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go. you're not gonna let me buy the knicks?? i can't believe you're taking this away from me! you're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds. uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy? i'll take this one too uh ... mommy? oh, i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel ""mommy"" when we're around emma. which i now realize we are not ... i'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word. although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""daddy"" too. oooh, i like that, ""daddy"" i ... i was just talking about rachel. oooh, is daddy getting angry? is daddy gonna spank me? well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no i can't. hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ... what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept with him!! .. alright, bye. dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right? well no, charlie's gonna get that. hey, don't say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job! he's the boss's son. come on, lottery!! ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes. ok, here we go. we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first. ooh, i have another idea! i'm sorry, idea time is over. ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl? yeah. what about the ones you have on the nightstand? there are no tickets on the nightstand! yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago. un, no you didn't! you must be mistaken! honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand! chandler, sense the tone!! well, well, well, look what mommy found!! ok, fine!! i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler. uh! the psychic also said that i would be betrayed. i can't believe this, i thought we were all in this together! hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago! 3 minutes ago!!! i don't know why that's important ... i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut, when did you even get those? when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic! i'll show you how. ok, well monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends? please ... if i win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and i couldn't get rid of you for 3 days! chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong? she's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ... ahhh! let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like i'm gonna get this job so i can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! there's the man i married!! all right, believe me.if you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us! fine! don't be my friends! i'll buy new friends! yeah, and then i'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you! oh! alright, you know what? that's it! i want my share of the tickets ! yeah, i want my tickets too ! and i'm buying the knicks! and steffi graff, ah ah! than i want mine, too ! and if i win i'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond. oh, you guys! we've got to keep all the tickets together no, no! we should divide them up and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them! hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! this all thing was my idea! oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery! ok, that's it! just give'em to me! i'll split them up! oh! ooooohhhhh! hey, hey!! ooooohhhhh! fine, i can't take it anymore! i'm putting an end to this! oh, if she jumps, i get her tickets. no, no! if we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! so, say goodbye to your tickets! . no!! don't come any closer! can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished... no, what's more important, your friends or money? friends! money! friends... hey monica, what about your extra tickets? they're all in there! even these five that i hid in my bra ... monica! ok, good! you guys were so scared! there was no way i was gonna dump this... oh god, no! i think i broke your bowl. go, go, go!! what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. and the wind sure made it fun. phoebe, we lost half of them. so, what? monica, we have the winning ticket! my psychic said i was gonna win, remember? weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon... as a matter of fact she said that's how i am going to die. so, excuse me for being a little skittish. hey, there's two messages. these could be from work! oh, play them! ok, here we go! ""hello. th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise"" ""i sh.. i shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. it-it was all my fault. not hers. bye. coo."" well, i bet that was very hard for him to do.

we'll take it. great. what!? they are totally ripping us off! dude, don't worry 'bout it! i know how we can make your money back! this is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! like those apples. instead of taking one, i'm... i take six! great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there! c'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time! dude, you're shaking! i think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple? hi! hey! joey, i gotta tell ya, i've been thinking all day about that scene you did, i mean, you were amazing! oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me! god, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow! ow, i'm just going over the script now! you wanna read lines with me?

everything we feel for each other. it's over! you have to accept that. how can i? knowing i'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing i'll never make love to you? how can i accept that... i can never kiss you again when it's all i can do not to kiss you right now. kiss me. what? kiss me. ah, rach, it doesn't say that! no, i'm saying... but, but.. just... don't talk... ehhh, aw! . well, that's new! hi, this is ross geller in suite 206. it seems you forgot a couple of things. could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? thank you! ok. toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and i feel like i am forgetting something... is there anything else you have that i haven't asked for already? yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. what did you get? usa today nice, put it with the others. and i also got... two more apples. we are four short of a bush-o . god i feel so alive, i love being in the country! i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant. oh, that's not cool. dude, none of this is cool. no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. for example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt i wish i'd thought this through. i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that. not my first time in a hotel, my friend. ok, how about this ? no, no, no, you can't take the remote control! yes, but the batteries... thank you, thank you very much! let's celebrate with some maple candy! no! at least tell me where you hid it. can i ask you a question? yeah. have you ever had any weird romantic dreams? let me think. oh, when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese, and on our wedding night i ate his head. ok, well this is like that...in no way. i had a...i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey. wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him? oh yeah! i mean, that was pretty intense. what do you think brought than on? i don't know! i mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday. a love scene? with who? olivia. olivia? i thought she was marrying connor! oh right, real life more important. so do you think that my dream means anything? i don't know. i mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for joey, maybe you have a thing for drake. ah! well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream... of course it was! trust me, when it comes to psychology i know what i'm talking about. i took two psych classes in college. you took the same class twice. it was hard! hey! hi. here, monica, look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! right? i mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man. oh...phoebe? maybe i wasn't clear before. i really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place. right, yeah, ok, i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault. phoebe, it's not what you wear. it's sort of your songs... i just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore. oh, ok. fine, i'll just, i'll take the hat back . hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work... my songs aren't good enough for your restaurant? ok, we're still on that. i didn't say your songs were not good enough. then what's wrong with them? would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food? tiny portions? yeah well, ""excuse me, i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but i can't see it, i can't see it""! phoebe, it's not about quantity. well...it's not about quality. oh really, you want to talk about quality? have you heard of a key? it's what some people sing in. well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. yeah, there are other ingredients monica. ok, so that's what we're doing. you know, when i'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, i'm wearing ear plugs. ear plugs, or cloves of garlic? you know what? i take back what i said before. you keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy. what are people having, the garlic martini? here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay. oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. oh, i didn't factor in the room tax. oh dude, don't worry about it, i found an unattended maid's car. we're way ahead of the game. oh my god. what? there's something new in the bowl. look, we have enough, just walk away. no, but i want...i want the pinecones! there's a forest right outside. it's not the same. ok, go quick! thank you for a delightful stay. oh, my maple candy! food here at 'javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'javu' ...will kill you.. thank god, it's just you! i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall. you'd better get back in that kitchen monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself. ok, you have to stop playing now. why? the only person my playing is bothering is you! oh yeah? ok, let's settle this, come on! get your garlic-peelers off me! excuse me, excuse me, hi, i'm monica geller..i'm the head chef here.. .. ok, i was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? ha! alright, let me ask you this question: how many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? . ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky? ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? . excuse us! alright here's a question: who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? oh...who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! i'm sorry... i'm sorry too... ooohh... hey! wanna stick around and i'll whip you up some dinner? yeah! as long as it's free! food here is ridiculously over-p... who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me? hey! hey! joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head? oh man! i thought i got it all! how...how...? i was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? uh-huh and i couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and i thought...well... how important can that be, right...? turns out very! wow...definitely just drake... what? what...how is it going with drake? oh...i don't think it's going very well... what...that scene i saw was so good! well, i'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so i'll give you a compliment? a little. yeah no, i really am worried, you know, i mean i have to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia. so? so...i've never played that! ooh! honey, it can't be that hard, i mean, you've been in love before? uh...well...just once...with you... ok...this could be a little awkward...i'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance? what the hell are you talking about?? alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene. oh! ok, yeah, i think i can do that. yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so i would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me. joey, you never..you never talked about that before... well.. hey, you know what else i could use? there's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! and he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when i would think to myself, my god, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz i knew i could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. thanks dude!!!this is great!! i got you something from vermont! besides tampons and salt? ooh! my god! maple candy! that's so sweet of you. that's weird...it's empty! hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?"

yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we don't have time for this. ok. ok, but you know what? i gotta say, i'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly! ah! i'm an actor! i can memorize anything! last week on ""days"" i had to say ""frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"". wow. what does that mean? no idea! but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"". ok! so let's move on to the renaissance? ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. touch it, it's really bumpy! . nah ah! nah ah! no no no! no ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings. come on! you... no! my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there. really helped speed the process along! janice! you're not... gone?

oh, chandler, look. you and monica are meant to have children. i am sure it's gonna be just fine. oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'... what, you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office? it was a ""wendy's!! "" ""ipan stripan, glupi glabi! "" and that is the swedish national anthem! thank you for asking! wow, ikea... what a rich culture. uhm, you know what? i have a friend who is a masseuse. oh, ja! ja! yah! she's... uhm... not very good though... uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is? i don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar... or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass! phoebe!! you know it's me? for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden! how can you come here? how could you not tell me you worked here? i don't have to tell you everything! yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage! tips not included. oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here? because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know... you pay a price. now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh! paying taxes! phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles and i so admire that! i don't have any! you know what? you are right. i am gonna quit. it's time i took my life back! good for you pheebs! ok. okay if you guys have microphones in there too, i didn't mean any of that. i love you. haha! got ya! die, die, die! respectfully, professor r. geller. hey! hi! hey, how was the met? the museum was amazing! yeah? joey really knows his art, huh? not so much, no. he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense. what do you mean? well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around. wait a minute... when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right? no, we went to the left. oh joey, joey! but still, i mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together. yeah, it's fun . what? actually, you know, joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird. what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on. well... i'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe i should be with someone... i have more in common with. you know what i mean? yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey a chance. i mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else. yeah, i guess that's true. and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you know, that's the kind of guy joey is. he is very sweet. plus he's hot! that was going to be my next argument. hey! hey! hey! you're ready? yeah, let's go. thanks ross. hey ross! that art stuff worked, you hooked me up. glad i could help man. although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... i made it work. it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now. hello? oh hi, doctor connelly. no, she's not here but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this? oh. well, so what does that mean? ok. ok, thank you. thanks. hey sweetie. doctor connelly just called. with good news? of course it is not good news, you just said ""doctor connelly just called"". if it was good news you would have said ""doctor connelly just called! "" but so what is it? is there a problem, uh? is there a problem with me or with you? actually it's both of us. what? apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment. oh... what does that mean? it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. it means... chandler? it means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us. oh my god! i'm sorry. i'm sorry too. well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out. i know. good morning phoebe. good morning receptionist. here's your schedule for the day. your first client is in room no. 1. rachel green? son of a bitch, she came back? are you ready for your scottish massage? put your face in the hole, lassy."
9.0,22.0,The Donor,"oh! that feels sooo good! oh, lucky me! coffee and a live sex show! i'm sorry, what? oh... oh, i'm sorry! i'm not... i was just-i was just reading to emma. from... cosmo?? yeah, yeah... it's... ""climax your way to better skin"". so, i have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, i'm soo bad at picking out clothes! so you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good. not me, not me, not me, not me, not me! oh hey rach! yeah... maybe you could take charlie shopping. oh, well... i'm sure you have better things to do. are you kidding? rachel loves to shop! and she has great taste! yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes. if you have the time, i'd really appreciate the help. ok, uh-uh... let's-let's shop!! ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, slutty! ok, great! all right, bye! pain in the ass!! that's off, right? what's the matter, pheebs? oh... mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. and she was like ""oh, don't worry! i asked him. he's totally ok with seeing you!"". so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally ok with seeing him! which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him! exactly! and you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous! i didn't even think about that! aaargh, sexual politics!! hey pheebs, i'm-i'm taking charlie shopping, why don't you come and i'll help you find something. ok, that'll be great! oh, ain't that nice? the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together. that's not what we're gonna do! why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'? wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face! oh, i so can't believe this! my uterus is an inhospitable environment? i was trying so hard to be a good hostess! oh, i can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!! hi there. hi. hi. i'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but i wanted to talk to you about your options. ok. above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! so, keep having sex on a regular basis. oh, damn it! don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out. ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor. ok. and, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt. is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! wow, talking about an inhospitable environment! hi! ok, you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping? oh, yeah! let's do it! alright, have a good time. not gonna find any clothes in there! hey, you guys! hi. guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference? umh... kurts baley? yeah, right! what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract well, why are you laughing? just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah! so you're up for keynote speaker! who's making the decisions? professor sherman, yeah. i've a meeting with him today. he's a pretty tough guy to impress. yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him. oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya? tsz... no! . hey guys! wait a minute, you guys. oh, i wanna ask you something. i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me. i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick. it's in barbados. but you come first! i'm there! we'll see you, guys! bye. bye, see ya. ok. all right, so. how did it go at the fertility clinic? not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample. so-so what did the doctor say? well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her. so you're ruling out surrogacy? yeah. so, i don't have to learn what that means? aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors. enough said, i'm there for you man. where is she, upstairs? ah-ha! how do you feel about all this? i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one. come on ross, be a good guy. step up and do it! what? what? no! i am not going to give them ben! the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are - are staggering. mmm-mm. i mean, we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. so-so what i am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles! oh, that's not what you want... incentive for men? oh, i'll take some of that. pheebs, that's for men! no, i know, this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i'm gonna smell like another guy. yeah. ok. oh good, i'm dating a russian cab driver. . seriously does anyone buy this? i smell like beets! so, you know what, i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. where do you think those would be? on melanie griffith in ""working girl"". i think what you want is over here. see, i told you i needed someone! oh, you know, by the way, as a ""thank you"", i would really love to take you out. really? yeah! actually joey and i are going to the movies tonight, wanna come? oh, i can't. because i-i've seen them. you've seen all the movies... yeah! i'm a big fan! of the movies, you know. motion pictures. the talkies! hey rach, will you come with me to a dressing room? sure! ok! wha, you know, maybe we can do something else! you know that depends on what it is! i've done a lot of stuff. so what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie? she's ok, i just don't get a really good vibe from her! why? i don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! you know, and just swept joey off his feet... i mean, nobody else has a chance! who else? anybody! you, me, you know, monica's mom... you like joey? shhhhh! phoebe! all right, look. i have a little thing for him. oh my god! it's just physical and i have it totally under control! ok? it's just, when i see them together, sometimes i just get a little jealous! uh, wow! isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him? oh, i get it! oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right. i know, i know, so it is just not a big deal. yeah. so can we keep this between us? sure! ok, great, because i gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me! oh. any chance charlie has a deaf twin? hi honey! hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work! oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, zack! you too. you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite! go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer. i got it. thanks. so, zack's pretty nice, uh? yeah, i guess. so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his! excuse me? well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is ""spermtastic""! chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! ""come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm""! no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out. chandler! i'm telling you, he's great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i'd think he'd be the way to go! i'm not going to be a part of this! you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor! ok! uh! zack! thanks! do you have a coaster? i don't wanna make a ring. tell me about yourself, zack! oh, god, do you think she heard? it would be so bad if she heard! well, maybe she didn't hear! ok i'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and i'll talk and see if you can hear me. ok, great! oh, thank god i can't hear a word that you're saying! i didn't say anything yet! well, get back in there and talk! i'm rachel. it's so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends. what!? well, some things are just hard to say to your face. ok well, i heard that! which means that she heard it too! ooh! we have a problem. oh! what are we gonna do? just be honest with her. oh my god! and it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone... alright! enough out of you! hello? joey! hey, i need to talk to charlie. is she there? no. no... eh... she went shopping with rachel. why? what's up? i'm meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker... oh! how's it going? it could be better! he, uhm... he fell asleep! what!? but i already bought my ticket to bermuda! barbados. fine, i'll rent a car and drive...! ross, you have to get that job! what am i supposed to do? he's out cold! in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder. well, just wake him up! i can't! if he realizes that i'm the one that put him to sleep, i won't get the job! uh! that's a tough one. oh! wait a minute, this happened to me before! yeah, i was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... yeah i mean hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!? hey guys! dinner's ready! oh! i'm gonna go wash up first. thanks! so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones! ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!! you don't like him. i think he is fine! it's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information. alright! just follow my lead! you guys have such a great place here. oh! thanks, i'm crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family? uhm... no. although i did have an uncle who voted for dukakis. that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack. okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet. oh, friends first, drunk in london, you know the story. i've got a better question for you: do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes? no... eh... heart disease, alzheimers, gout? you guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh? we're just making conversation. ok. i heard a joke today. it's pretty funny... you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and i'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. can we just talk about something else? sure! alright... ravioli's delicious! i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child? no i didn't. yess!! we're teeth people zack! alright! let's just do it. let's just go over there and see if she heard. good plan. ok. wha...? where? where are you going? oh! i'm sorry rachel, i don't have time for your childish games, ok? i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at ""who's more over who""! hey, hi! hey, where've you been? oh! trying on clothes. oh! wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? well, that's so weird! phoebe and i were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. god it's just such a small world! rachel... i heard you guys whispering. oh god. you did. you heard. ok, listen, let me explain. no! there's nothing to explain. i heard you. phoebe likes joey. yeah. it's just that... i don't understand it... i mean, phoebe likes joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...? yeah! that's phoebe. that's phoebe. you know, she just wants them all! it's like she's a nympho! wow! yeah... you know, by the way. i heard you tell her not to do anything. thanks for sticking up for me. you are such a nice person. i try... oh my god! you really want me to be the keynote speaker? thank you! you're welcome. wow! you look... ... stop-eating hot! which is like the highest level of hotness! are you sure? because i'm really dreading going to this party. then don't go! mike knows i'm coming, and if i don't show up he'll think it's because of him! and i don't want to lose face! that's a very serious thing in my culture. alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike. and afterward you come to my place and i'll get you good and drunk! you got it! ok. but not on the wine that you made, ok, because i just don't want to go back to the emergency room. david? phoebe! hi! oh my god! wow, you look unbelievable. yeah. what-what are you doing here? well, i'm back from minsk... permanently. what happened? well, remember how i was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles? yeah? well, after eight years of research i discovered that it can't be done. well, it's great that you're back! how are you? good, good, life is good... good! ah well, i-i'm seeing someone. oh, good for you. she's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, i mean, i saw what you had with that mike guy, and i just said ""boy, i want that"". mike and i broke up. you're kidding me. because i'm not seeing anybody, i've just totally made that up. really? yeah, i don't know why, i'm sorry, i guess i just didn't want to lose face. i understand. yeah. ok so then ok, so we're both living in new york, not seeing anyone. that's so not like us! yeah, i know. well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now? well... no. do you wanna get a drink? i'd love to. great. ok. do you smell beets? oh, got it, stay upwind of me. hey, there's phoebe! is that mike she's with? no, that's david. there's a third guy? tip of the iceberg. i'm gonna take off now. you're gonna let me go home, aren't you? you sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer? no, no, i should get home, i'm kinda tired. are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression. no it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. i'll see you tomorrow. ok. i think we've found our sperm! does seem pretty perfect. yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him? no. why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway! no, that's not it. it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, i just... i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you. yeah, he's better! no, he's not. and if i can't get pregnant with you, then i don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else. really? are you sure? yeah, i'm sure. thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm. that is so sweet. i love you. so you know this leaves us with... adoption. how do you feel about that? i think i feel ok about it. actually i think i feel really good about it. me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way. so this is it, we're really gonna adopt? yeah. oh my god, we're gonna be parents! we are gonna be great parents. and it could be soon. i mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived. wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking! hey, zack! hey chandler. look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable. no you didn't. really? no you did. my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it. here are the boards for friday's pitch . oh, thank you. you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"

""i do"" ""i do"". ok, i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee. david is going to propose to phoebe. what? why? be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married. chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke? i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said? they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she'll say ""no"", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again. man, that's some bad advice! oh! hey! thank god you guys are here! hey! hey what's going on? everything is upside down here! it rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous! alright, i don't wanna alarm anybody, but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed! ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?! that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross! come on, i'll show you guys where to check in oh, honey, can you make sure we get a king size bed! oh! david, get one for us too! oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! and with mirrors on the ceiling! and make sure our room isn't next to theirs . ooh! you guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. that's all, i just wish i could share that with a guy. not joey. not joey, no, i was just lusting after chandler. yeah, right! so, ehm... i'm proposing to pheobe tonight. tonight?! isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? oh, there it is! yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. that's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. and the clarity is uhm... is quite poor. nice! monica, can i talk to you for a sec? ok! david is going to propose to phoebe tonight! see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to? that would be advice!! ok fine. i'll handle this. phoebe? yeah? i need to talk to you. are you leaving ""the supremes""? ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. look, david is going to propose to you tonight. wow? really? that's fantastic! what are you serious? you wanna marry him? wha... what about mike? oh, ok, you want me to marry mike? alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. i can just see it: ""mike, do you take phoebe..."" you know, it's every girl's dream! do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer? sure! look, ok, bottom line: i love mike... david! david. i love david. don't look at me that way, roseanne rosannadanna! by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century. it's great. you're gonna be the hit of the conference. oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because i won't be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. . hey guys! the chocolates aren't here yet. damnit! ross just read me his speech. it's fantastic! oh, is it on the computer, cuz i'd love to give it a read...? if you want to check your email, just ask! what? may i? what's with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season. actually the wet season is june to december. it's not the time charlie. oh, no, no, no dear god, no! oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? oh! secret teapot? your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone! wha... what do you mean? it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive. what, oh my god. what did you do? someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it. why, why would you open it? well, it didn't say ""this is a virus""!! what did it say? nude... ... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry. what... what am i gonna do? my speech is gone, chandler! it's not gone! i mean, i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right? no! i don't!! well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...! it's really gone? yep! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career! i just feel awful. yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she's never even won a major tournament! well, i tried billy jean king, but... you know, you and monica have the same ""i'm gonna kill you"" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her... get out! you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work. well, what do you do? well, i usually go... play tetris on somebody else's computer. i can't believe this. i can't believe this is happening. i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! ok? i have to stand up in front of all these people. what am i gonna say? i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions. i don't think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now, joe! ross, we can solve this. i just heard your speech. we can recreate it! we've got all night! wha... what you really think we can do that? oh wait, joey and i are supposed to have dinner . hey don't worry about that! i mean, ross needs you! and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can. ugh. alright, ok, let's do it. uhm, i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era, the breakup of pangea, hello! and then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the triassic. oh, oh! any chance any of this happened in a ""galaxy far, far away""? . hello? ok, mike, enough is enough, now you love phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""i never want to get married"" thing and step up! who is this? this is monica! i'm phoebe's friend. listen, phoebe is back with david and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but i know she really wants to be with you! he... he's gonna propose? i... i'm sorry, did you say something? i can't hear through all this damned hair! look, if phoebe wants to marry david, she should, i'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you. you don't tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while i've got you, you've got curly hair. what do you do in humidity? damnit! well, i hope you're happy! oooh! i hope you're happy too, honey! phoebe is going to say ""yes"" to david. see, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives! phoebe is going to say ""yes""? that's, that's great! no it's not, b'cause she's still in love with mike! and there's not chance that will work? no, i called him. it's not gonna happen. oooooooh! meddler! meddler! well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, i wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place! this vacation sucks!! i'm so bored! stupid rain, we... we can't do anything. well, i've brought some books. we could read. hey, it hasn't come to that yet. hey hey hey! don't mind if i do! i'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention hey rach, do you feel like going to a convention? we can't. we're not pharmacists! i know we're not, but frank medeio and... eva trorro... womba... kate miller? kate miller it is. and... that's the most sex i'm gonna have this weekend. in that case should i make sure it's on real good? thank you. and then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the mesozoic era in the 21st century. yeah, that's it? yeah. oh my god, we did it! actually i did it ross. you remembered shockingly little of your own speech. yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products. this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. that's a pretty necklace. thank you. hey, what do you say we celebrate? champagne? oh yeah! hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you. oh my god, i love you. oh, this is such a cute picture of emma. and is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation? that's ben, my son from my first marriage. your first marriage? yeah. you're married more than once? no. so, why did you break up? oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? she... she was... eh... gay. oh my god, this is so cool! ok, odd thing to get excited about! no, it's just... i was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay! hey! high-five! didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? my fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner. my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. she didn't get any fitter. right and then everybody finds out and they're like: ""oh, i knew all along"" i know! it's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? i mean, call, or leave a note: ""hi, i just dropped by to say your wife's gay"" i know! and then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome? i didn't do that. me neither. well, who knew? pharmacists are fun. i know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home. not enough pills in the world, rach. what about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like? well, let's see. there was a really big guy that i was talking to, with the really nice breasts... but what about back home, anything going on there? anybody you like? no. there it is, you're blushing! no, i'm not blushing, i'm sunburnt! from, you know, the rain. you like someone. tell me who it is. who is it? no. tell me who it is. joey! come on who? who do you like? tell me. you're not getting away that easy. who do you like, who? joey, come on! it doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen. what? why not? rach, who can you not get? oh! ok. ok, you really wanna know who it is? yeah, who is that? do ya? yeah. hey! i just left you a message! ross and i were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner. right, of course. hey, did you guys finish the speech? yep, we got it, we got it. thank you so much. i had a great time. alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because i really wanna know who... later! la... so, shall we? yeah. ok. see you, bye. bye. good night. night. ok, good night! i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david. she's clearly in love with mike. you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that. uh, phoebe, uh, i have... something i wanna say. oh my god, he's gonna do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let's go. i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk? ""uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..."" spit it out, david! uh, phoebe, uh... you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn't help! sure, ok, yeah. but well, now that we're together again, i don't ever want to be apart. so, to that end... oh my god, mike! it's david, actually! no, mike's here. hi mike! hi david. chandler. monica... oh! it's the humidity! hi phoebe. what are you, what are you doing here? i have a question i need to ask you. i have a question i was kinda gonna ask her myself. yeah, i understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this. ok, would you care for my seat as well? actually yeah, that'll be great. that's fair, you've had a long trip. phoebe, i love you. i mean, i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason, but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you. kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say. sorry david, but she really has to know this. alright, but after this i want to see you outside. if the rain stops. you're the most incredible woman i've ever met. how can i lose you? now, i don't actually have a ring... i have a ring. i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy. phoebe, will you marry me? no! uhm... ha ha! i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future. we can have any future you want. ok, i'm gonna take off. david, i'm so sorry, i'm sorry. just so i know, if i had asked first... yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong. please, you don't have to explain. i mean, perhaps if i hadn't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us. and i wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. it was a good trip! is it ok if i hug you now? yes! because of our meddling! alright? oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day. i know open your drapes! open your drapes! i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms! the sun is out! hey! remember when i had corneas? ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion. ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes. nooo! damn it! walls are pretty thin, guys! then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating. look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, i'm so jealous! finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus... not to mention the cold sores. and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development. really? but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus... what? he said ""erectus""! you're... you're kidding, right? no, he really said it. ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus... erectus? homo. ... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century. thank you! oh, thanks guys! i thought... it was wonderful! oh! jarvis oberblau, cornell. i mean, the ideas you put forth and, and from someone... so... young... and... . ok... now... now we're just holding hands! all right! well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?

yeah! a little bit, yeah... i think we need to talk...! yeah... i think we do... ... about what? c'mon guys, it'll be fun! all right, all right... i'll play if we don't keep score! but then how do we know who wins?

i don't know, i'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... i mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?... uh, am i curious? i mean, i am as curious as... as... george!! who...? curious george ! you know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat! oh yes, of course, i remember him! yeah, he had a paper route. yeah, he did! oh, see, this is what i'm talking about! no, i know, yeah i know we're great but rach no... this... this can't happen! but can it... just... happen a little bit? no, no! it can't happen at all! but why, why not? because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no! i couldn't do it to ross! but that wasn't gonna stop you before! i know, i know! but i've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... i'm sorry...! i'm sorry, too! oh god! i shouldn't have said anything! no! no-no-no-no-no-no! hey! hey, we'll be fine! li... hey, like you said: no big deal! it's not a big deal! no big deal! it's so not a big deal! yeah! i'll see ya later! yeah! ok! ok, i... aaahhhh! ooh! i'm sorry! i think, i think, that may have missed the table! do you? ah, yeah! do you? ah, yeaaah! do you? ah yeaaaah! do you really find this attractive on him? oh, yeah! are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by monica, right now? i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one. c'mon mike, you can beat her! knock that dog off her head! oh, damn it! i sleep with him! game, point! don't get too cocky! remember i won the last one! oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl? you know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that. no, no, nooo! and that's how it's done! okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner. best out of three? that's what i'm thinking. should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil? serve the ball, chump! : serve the ball, chump. ok mike, better come back mike, better come back. i'm just saying, i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty! ooh, well. ah, i kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that i wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. jarvis? oh, you're back... this is my wife, nancy. get out! ross, can i talk to you for a minute? yes, please! so, what's going on? uh, well... joey and i broke up. oh my god, wh-what happened? joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! i mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus! i knew that was him! anyway i just, uh, i think it's for the best. hey, you ok? i guess. there was hum... there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey. i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone else. ok geller. last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker. oh, professor clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here. yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later? or we could throw you both in now! ok, gentlemen! please! aren't we a little old for this? i mean, we're scientists, right? we're academics. and most importantly i... you-you will have to catch us first. . go, go, go! ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41. ok, look! enough is enough! no, i have just to have two more points to beat him! monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head! i can't just walk away! i've put in four hours! but... look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness! what about the obsessive cleaning? that's just good sense! aww! you ok? no, no, no. honey, i'm ok. shake it off! oh, no! no shaking, no shaking! ooh! ooh! oh my god! i can't play! so you forfeit? mike wins? i can't believe it! i lost! no, you didn't. what? because i'm gonna play for ya. you can't do that! oh, that's ok. i don't care which of them i beat. ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister. honey, you don't have to do this. yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because i love you. but... you suck! you're welcome, sweetheart. all right mike, let's get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins. ok! oh my god! you're good! it's like watching porn! and that's... how... it's done! oh my god. that was so amazing! when did you hold on! i almost forgot loser! when did you stop sucking? i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was! why? i don't know. this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments! that's why! thanks! hi. are they still looking for us? yeah. the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. you know, we as a group are not the coolest. i don't think they saw us. i don't think they did. hum, so, i started to say you something earlier, hum... there was another reason i realized it was time to end it with joey. i kind of realized i... was starting to have feelings... for someone else. oh. can i... can i ask who? i think you know. i think i know too but i've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so... i'm sorry... we... we can't. all right, all right. i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it'd be a really really bad idea. or-or not! what?"

oh my god, it's ross. what are we gonna do? oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. just be calm. for all he knows we're just hanging out together. right? just be nonchalant. that's not nonchalant! no idea what it means. oh... okay, just hide! rach? coming! try under the bed, try under the bed! there's no room under the bed. is everything okay? yeah... hey. hi... you know where joey is? ...i really don't... can i talk to you for a minute? yeah, sure... i don't believe this... have you guys been... shhh... this is the listening side of the wall. and then she told me that she and joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me. uh-huh... right... yeah... and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her. oh, i know... i know it's been really hard for you. anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. i mean, how angry do you think joey is gonna be? that is hard to say, ross. that is hard to say. you know, i gotta go find him. he's gotta be here someplace. you would think! joey! is he gone? how are you doing this? pssst... how... wha... hey! what are you... what is this? have you guys been listening this entire time? ye-ah! now, what is this? ah, what is this? well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so i guess this is sixth grade! oh no... have you thought about it how complicated this could get? what about ross? well, he's with charlie now. yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. and as his friend, i mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you? you're a pain in my ass, geller! all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it... okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? the people that care about you? sure... enunciate! get out! are they right? probably, yeah... i mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to ross. yeah... yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight. yeah, i think that'd be best... so, so i'm gonna... i'm gonna take off... although... i like although! i mean, you know... ross and i haven't dated in like... six years... six years? wow... it's almost as long as highschool... plus, you know, he is with charlie now. absolutely! he's not thinking about you. no... i'm thinking about you... yeah... let's forget about ross... forgotten. what's wrong? nothing... seriously... what is it? nothing... it's really... it's nothing... come here, come here... what's wrong? sorry, i just uhm... i can't seem to get ross out of my head... well, maybe i can help. ooh, your lips are so soft... do that again... yeah... we really need to talk to ross... yeah hey! hey! you guys ready to go?

learn about jesus... hey! so, did you talk to joey? uh, no... no. i couldn't find him. i'm just gonna talk to him on the plane. yeah, sounds like a good idea... dr. geller! stop it! phd you're filthy! hey, have you guys seen monica? uh, actually i think she went to the salon. oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright... check it out! who's day just got better? chandler! hey!... aaaaaahhhh! what do you think? i think.... i think i can see your scalp. don't you just love it?

oh, i uh, i mean, i... dude, i spent the whole conference with charlie. i understand... no, i'll do it. wish i could switch with someone. i really don't wanna sit with allen iverson over there. uhm... you know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin... you should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during... aaah... you're not good at this... you don't have to go home tonight, do you? no, i think i can come over. it's saturday, right? oh... what? uhm... i can't do anything tonight. why not? i have a date. you have a... you have a date? with who? oh, it's... my girlfriend. you have... have a girlfriend?

i'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. i promise. oh, okay... good. you do that. and then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you. maybe i'll sign for it. tear it open. pull out the packing material... you know what, we're gonna have sex. let's just leave it there. right, i'm gonna go talk to joey. i think this is the right time. he's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty free"". okay... good luck. ross is coming over. i think now would be a really good time to talk to him. i guess so. i'm just... really nervous. okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner. ooh... still nervous? i'm gonna get the lasagna. hey rach... yeah! do you mind if i sit here for a sec.? yeah, yeah sure! yeah! hey! hey! so, i uhm... kinda need to talk to you about charlie. yeah? okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... well, charlie and i were talking, and..., well... you kissed. wha... what? what would give you that idea? i saw you. yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay. ross, ross, ross... it's okay. what? it's okay. you know, i totally understand, alright? you guys, make way more sense than her and i ever did, you know. and... i want you to be happy. are you serious? yeah... now i have something... i am speachless... i mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. i mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that? oh... uh... look... before you... no, i mean it. you are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous... i am those things, yeah. you know what? i know chandler longer, so i always think of him as my best friend, but now... i may have to rethink some stuff... dude! hey, if there is ever, anything i can do for you... i can't think of anything. thanks! yeah. so hi! hi! so you eh, you talked to joey? ah, yeah. we had a really good talk. oh! that's great! yeah! oh, so everything's okay? oh, no, it's great. it's great. he is... he is an amazing guy. ah... well, obviously i think so too. well, i'm so excited about this. really? excited? are you kidding? i have had some very dirty dreams about this... excuse me! you didn't tell him, did you? i couldn't. he was saying all these really nice things about me. i didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. i'm on a edge on chandler. oh god! alright, fine. you know what joey, forget it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him. thank you. yeah, i appreciate that. hi, mike's place. hey, it's mike. ooh, that was fast. oh, err... no, she's not here yet. you know, i think i'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone... yeah, you can't do that! oh, come on mike, strap on a pair.why don't you just tell her that we got back together. you know, women appreciate honesty. we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. just f.y.i. one more thing... there... might be a picture of precious on my coffee table. her name is precious? is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound? anyway, i just wanna give you a heads up. okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. hi, i'm precious, who are you? i... i'm phoebe. phoebe? mike's ex-girlfriend phoebe, the love of his life? that phoebe? enchanté oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these... ow! you go back to work tomorrow night, right? yeah! so if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn? well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be able to do this. you like that, right? what are you singing? it's ""bolero"" from ""10"". it's ""ride of the valkyries"" from ""apocalypse now""... see, here's the thing: the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... i hate them! you what? you said you liked them. did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp. fine, so you don't like them. everybody else does. again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey... well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different. you know what? i don't care. i like it like this, and i'm gonna keep it. you're just jealous because your hair can't do this... ouch! hit yourself in the tooth? and the eye! hi... there she is. hi emma. oh my god, i missed you. oh emma, i missed you so much. hey... did you have a good time with grandma green? huh? did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? that was one time, ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams. ooh hey, emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? okay? i want you to wait right here. come here sweetie. aaah... ross, actually there's something that i really need to talk to you about. okay, shoot! okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal. oh no! what? what is it? oh, major shampoo explosion! uh, look ross, this really isn't easy. oh, it's all over everything. why? why me? because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo? i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you were saying? well, yeah... okay, look it's about me and... oh, not another one! oh my g... and this is moisturiser. it's even harder to clean! why? why do bad things happen to good people? wow! well, clearly this is not a good time. duh, you think? okay, bye. alright, so mike's on his way over. see, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. point is... i'm gonna take off. i'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. i mean, are you guys getting back together or something? alright... susie, can i call you susie? my name is precious. yeah, i can't say that. uhm... susie, i'm gonna be straight with you... mike and i are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. and he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours. i just can't believe this... why? well, i don't... oh, why would he do this? i mean, what's wrong with me? nothing, there's nothing wrong with you. i mean, what the hell am i supposed to do now? damn it woman, pull yourself together! have some pride, for the love of god. okay, not a fan of the tough love. i just can't believe that mike didn't give me any warning. but he didn't really know, you know. he wasn't planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me... he proposed to you? this is the worst birthday ever. look, precious... mike's not worth this. you're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, mike's kind of a wang. i mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... he was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? and, i don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend. oh, my god, maybe you're right. maybe i don't need him. i deserve to be treated with respect. screw you, mike. you're a coward and a bastard, and i hope you rot in hell. you're welcome! honey, you've been in there for a long time... is everything okay? not really. i have a problem. really? what happened? well, i was dancing around, and singing ""no woman, no cry"" and i got stuck. you can't move at all? oh, well, i can move... if i untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose? i guess so... some of these look a little frayed. yeah, i tried to gnaw myself free. hey! hi! so, did you err... did you tell ross? well, i tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. so i guess now it's your turn again. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... i think it's better if you tell him, you know. it's easier for a woman. that way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... i didn't mean it. i'm so so--ooory. yeah, 'cause that's what we do. alright, alright, okay, uhm... how 'bout this, how about this?

yeah! i wrote emma a song. oh, yeah! how was i supposed to know? joey, it's a birthday party. yeah, but for a one-year-old. what's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer. and he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""el-moo""! yeah... that's a funny cup! hey! hey hey! where's the birthday girl? oh, she's still napping oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening. look, i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? emma will never have a first birthday again. all right... you're right. we're sorry. now let's wake up emma and get the fun time started! no really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up. are you freaking kidding me, green?

um, my present! what did you get her? actually we prepared performances. separate performances. but equally real! well, this sounds like fun! well, you know what? actually? people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?

joe, i told you, you're just not right for the part. what do you mean? rach, don't i seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from? i'm sorry, this sounds like something i'm never gonna be interested in. look, c'mon, please? it's not like i'm asking for some crazy favour. this is what i do for a living. i am a professional actor! oh, man, i'm two hours late for work! . look, here's a copy of my reels. it's got all the commercials that i've been in. joe... just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses! fine! thank you. work, joe! damn it! what am i gonna do now? just pass it to your boss! he's not right for the part. so if i suggest him, my bosses are gonna think i'm an idiot! and that's something they should learn on their own! just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys. that's good! i liked it, they didn't. joey, for god's sake, go to work! . i can't believe i'm about to meet benjamin hobart. i've always thought of him as one of the people i'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. do you think there's any chance he'll bring christie brinkley or c3po? sorry, looks like it's just him. charlie! my god, you look absolutely stunning! well, i... i am having a good hair day. so good to see you. me too. i'm ok. i'm sorry... ross geller... benjamin hobart. it's an honor to meet you. i can't tell you how long i've been an admirer of your work, i mean, that nobel prize, whoooo! i mean, i have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons i got into the field. oh, well, likewise. actually, not likewise. i've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice! shall we?

so, tell me about it. ok well, i would like to do a dig in the painted desert. m-m. see, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated. break up with charlie! what? what? did you just say ""break up with charlie""? well, yes, and now. yes i did say it, and no, i didn't not say it. kind of inappropriate, don't you think? i'm sorry. i just haven't seen her for so long! all these feelings are rushing back! i'm starting to realize how much i missed her, and i'm gonna need you to break up with her. are you serious? if you say yes then i'm serious, if you say no then i'm joking! no! joking it is! hi! sorry, i'm late. hey, how did it go with mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting? no, he really hates it. but he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! so you got to pick your battles. but the good news is, gladys is yours! wow, what's the bad news! who's gladys? oh, she's that work of art i made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame. oh, and monica gets to keep her? in her house? i am so jealous! oh, i didn't know you wanted her too! huh! well, i mean, sure, of course. but... you already gave that to monica, so... you know, i would give her up, for you. no, i couldn't let you do that. but i want to. but i don't want you to. but i insist! but i insist harder! girls, girls, stop, ok? we'll flip a coin. heads, she's rachel's, tails she's monica's. . tails! monica, she's yours! no, that landed in your food! no, no, that's ok. you won fair and square. i'm so sad! hey joe! what's up? bad news. i watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested. oh. i'm sorry man. but, ehm... you watched the tape? yeah! i... i... i liked it! but, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. stupid sons of bitches! you didn't watch the tape. what!? of course i did! look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me? i'm not lying to you, i watched it! well, you lied again! i watched it! keep going pinocchio! i did! no you didn't! i'm telling you, i watched the tape. did you watch the tape? no! the selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. the ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions i ask here. i'm gonna start with dr. li. dr. li, you claim the field is too reliant on the linnaean taxonomic system. how do you propose to correct this problem? well, i believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. i plan to begin there. interesting. i guess! dr. biely, your proposal includes some field work. where might that take place? primarily in the pierre shale region of south dakota. certainly. very well. and dr. geller, when is my birthday? what? i... i... care to venture a guess? may 12th? that's not even kinda close! dr. li, how many graduate students you'd be needing? half a dozen. i see, and dr. biely? three for excavation and two for analysis. certainly. dr. geller, which 1965 shirelles hit was later covered by a popular british invasion band? wha..? i need 6 graduate students. no! i'm sorry, we were looking for ""baby it's you"". baby it's you. wha...? wait, wait, wait, just a minute. none of my questions have anything to do with paleontology. you're right, i apologize. scratch the last question. spell ""boscodictiasaur"". um... i've never heard of a ""boscodictiasaur"". yeah, i just made it up. spell it. ok. b - o - s ... no, it starts with a silent ""m"". oh come on!! i can't believe joey. i hate being called a liar! but you are a liar. what did i just say? you still here? yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt. i am insulted. when i tell somebody i did something... ok whoah-hey... let me just stop you right there, ok? first, you lied, right? then, you lied about lying, ok? then you lied about lying about lying, ok? so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... stop lying! why are you so sure i didn't watch this tape? you wanna know wh...? you wanna know why? well, this is going well. here's how i know you didn't watch the tape, ok? if you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. alright, now remember, i got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in japan. joey says ""ichiban"". it displays a few girls dancing around and joey fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them saying ""lipstick for men!"" it goes on to show him playing a guitar and putting on more blue lipstick. in the end he says seductively ""ichiban... lipstick for men"" and ""sahiko"" and it ends. chandler and rachel are speechless.) and that's how i know you didn't watch the tape! . he really is a chameleon. well, gladys say hello to your new home! oh, my! wow! oh, she's so nice and big! oh, monica, where are you going to display gladys oh so proudly? i haven't really settled on a spot yet! well, hey! how about right above the tv? . that way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door! yeah, yeah! and you can get rid of that french poster. i like that poster! really? it doesn't have anything coming out of it. or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom? oh! there's nothing above your bed!! are you still here? oh hi! hello! uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? aunt margaret's pants size? i've come here to apologize. i think i may have let my feelings for charlie interfere with the interview process. no! stop! anyway, i've decided to offer you the grant. really? well... there is just one small... stipulation... i have to break up with charlie? hey, you got one right! you're crazy. crazy, or... romantic? crazy! ooor... get out! o-oh my god! what? joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here? i got it from monica. she sold it to me for a very reasonable price. joey, we're not keeping this! but it's an original buffay... alright, fine. you can keep it. as long as you don't mind that she's haunted. hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!? well, legend has it joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep. she climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. and then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob. get that legless witch out of here! hey! i sold that to joey. well, why i told him it's haunted. two can play at this game. no, too late. you can't give it back! yes i can! no you can't. she's yours! she's yours! she's yours! she's yours! hey! she's mine! she's m-i-i-ne! she's mine! she's mine! you guys! you guys! you don't have to fight over her anymore. whoever doesn't get gladys gets glynnis. i want gladys! she's mine! she's mine! she's mine! she's mine! look, i'm sorry i didn't give them your tape. and i promise, next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not. that's not the point chandler. the point is that you lied. i know. you're right. what's it gonna take for you to forgive me? oh my god! excellent! now, what do you say? lying is wrong! and?... and? i'm a pretty little girl. i knew it! your ex-boyfriend is insane. did you get the grant? no i didn't, and you want to know why? because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you. what? yeah. he wouldn't give me the grant, because i wouldn't give you up. benji isn't in love with me. i mean, he broke up with me. and besides, he's a very ethical man. really? is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of ""underdog""? i'm sure he was just joking, ross. if you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? i'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question. seriously? oh, i'm sorry, no. he did ask me one. uhm... how do you spell mboscodictiosaur? well, if it's like the lake mbosco in congo, then m-b-o... damnit! dr. geller...? charlie... what are you... what are you doing here? i want you to tell her everything. about the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... wally cox! that's the voice of underdog! like i tried to tell you in the interview ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia. no, no, no. don't do that! i want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth. benji? alright, it's true. i behaved horribly. but it's only because i still love you. and i would do anything to have you back in my life. too little, too late, benji! i can't believe this. i never should have broken up with you. i think about you all the time. i mean, do you ever still think about me? no! yes! what? i don't know what to say, benji. this is all so.... romantic. or... listen, i know, i may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back? maybe... sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable. oh god! i am so sorry, but... i mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know... i'm sorry too... i love you! i love you too! okay, that's it. we are seeing other people! gladys? ha ha ha, third time this week. man, this does not get old. you're mean! oh, don't be such a baby!"
10.0,7.0,The Home Study,"hey you guys! hey! hey, what are you doing? oh, figuring out our wedding plans. that's funny, we were doing the same thing! yeah! it's really crazy! the hall, the dress, the food... i-i had no idea how expensive this stuff was! yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked when i first heard the numbers. so what did you two do about it? it was pretty simple actually, i came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell. there's no way around it pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money. i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry. yeah, and i'm responsible for just like half of that. but really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use? are you serious? yeah! now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall? i think it would make me wanna marry you even more. i've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture! maybe you do that next time you get married! no, no, no. the next time it's gonna be a hawaii at sunset. but maybe the time after that! hey! hey! what's going on? our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment. we? you know you don't want me to help. you can't have it both ways! hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby? kind of. she's coming by to interview us and see where we live. and it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state. hey, maybe i should stop by! she could be a soap opera fan! it's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity. little people? celebrity. ok, so i think i'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes? what...? no! chandler? i don't, and i'm offended by the insinuation! ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the vcr? i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine. it isn't mine! well, i guess we'll never know whose it is! may i help you? yes. we're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children. well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated. well, i think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one well, this is very generous! and we don't want any recognition. this is completely anonymous. completely anonymous. from two kind strangers. mr. x and phoebe buffay. well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter. not necessary. buffay is spelled b-u-f-f-a-y. and ""x"" is spelled uhm... ""mike hannigan"". right. well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much. sure, i so glad we did this. it feels so good! it does. it feels really good! oh, look! and we get these free t-shirts! oh, actually, that's the shirt i wore to the gym. mhm... it's moist. hi! hi! emma will be up in a minute! oh, good! oh hey ross... listen, i heard about you and charlie. i'm really sorry. oh, that's ok. i'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there. absolutely. there was one! she's it! all the rest look like they should live under a bridge! so, uhm... what are you gonna do today? well, i was thinking of taking emma to the playground! oh my god, what!? like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire! ok, look, ross. i do not want emma going to the playground. be-caaauuuse... all right, well, if you must know... i had a traumatic... swing incident... when i was little. seriously? yes, i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. and to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! and it was uneven for weeks! and you made it through that? i wonder who's gonna play you in the movie! ok, fine! you can make fun of me. i do not want emma going there. and i was thinking claire danes. look, i'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? but the swings are perfectly safe, and besides emma loves them. you know what, you should come with us and you'll see! ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! ok? when you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth! space is filled with orbiting children. look, please, just come on, you know, when you'll see the look on emma's face, i swear you won't regret it. all right! good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you? irrational, huh? all right, well, i'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment! oh, yeah, that's the same, i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings! ok, ok, here we go. ok. here we go. stand up straight. big smile. hello, is this the creepy residence? we're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, i'm glad you're here. i was cleaning this morning and i found this . i don't know if you wanna use it, but... awe, this is so sweet of you! but you know what? i won't be needing a veil, i actually won't be wearing a dress at all! i told you! i am not coming to a naked wedding! no, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity. that's crazy! . i am sorry. i just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that! we, you know, we're different! we don't care about having a huge party. this is really nice for you, but, oh, please, i put this on? and, ow, i look , why, well, radiant. all right, well, who cares, i don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress. that's right. you're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the plaza or, where are you gonna do it? city hall. ow! oh, that sounds nice! i am just there for jury duty. they really spruce that place up! it's ok, it's ok. i made my decision. what i really want is a great big wedding yay! but you already gave all your money to charity! well, i'll just ask for it back! i don't think you can do that! why not! this is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids! that's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady. ok, careful. ok. careful, watch her hair. watch her hair! rach, she's got like three hairs! i know but they're just so beautiful! oh, my god, i just pulled one out. i promise you she's safe! no watch how much she loves this. ok. ready sweety? ok. here we go! ok, careful, ok. oh, she's smiling! oh my god, she does like it! see, i told you! awe! oh my god! looks, she's a little dare-devil! oh, let me push, can i push? oh, absolutely! ok. oh god. get the camera, it's in the diaper bag. ok! see? scared of swings, i bet you feel pretty silly ow! we're seriously asking for our money back? it's for our wedding day! right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting. wow! are you here to make another donation the same day? i don't think that that's ever happened before. gay, go. oh my god, i love your shirt! the donation we made earlier, we k..., we w..., we want it back. excuse me? yeah. see, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do. so you're asking us to refund your donation to the children? yeah! this feels really good. i am sorry. i am, but this wedding is just really important to me. hey, it's not my business, besides it's probably a good thing. we really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing... hey, that's not fair! a person's wedding is important! and especially to me! ok? i didn't have a graduation party! and i didn't go to prom. and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to ""kill me"" or whatever. so i deserve a real celebration and i am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it. she could have been talking about either one of us. hi, i am laura, i am here for your adoption interview. hi, i am monica and this is chandler. please come in. thank you! would you like something to drink? oh, water would be fine. ok. great. i am so glad that you are here. we're really excited about getting this process started. oh, because we love kids. love 'em to death.well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law. your place is just lovely. ah, thank you. this building does have a wholesome family feel to it. you know, i... i feel like i've been here before. are any other couples in the building adopting?

no! hello...? oh hi... oh my god...! really...? i can't wait to tell chandler... ok, goodbye. wrong number? it was laura... she gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list. that's great! now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. oh... hello...?

10.0,8.0,The Late Thanksgiving,"hey guys! hi! hey! we need to talk to you about something. yeah. we don't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year. what? hey! are you kidding? well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. that doesn't sound like you... that's monica talking! no, no! we made this decision together. she's putting words in your mouth! don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths! i can't believe this! this is emma's first thanksgiving! no, it's not! it's not? when was she born? well, personally i think it's great you're giving yourself a break. thank you, pheebs! sure. it's just as well... i mean, last year wasn't very good. i think she's losing her touch. what? you are way off, lady! am i? really? am i? well, why don't you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. you'd be in competition... with yourself. that's my favourite kind! okay, we are doing this! don't let yourself get manipulated this way! hey, stay out of this, chandler! this is between me... and me! we are supposed to make these decisions together! did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you? hey! hi! happy thanksgiving! oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day. you guys, i ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on bleecker. could you pick them up for me? you're not making the pies yourself? no, no, no, i don't make chocolate pies. when i was younger i-i enter in this pie-eating contest. i ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick. did you at least win the contest? 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! okay, i see you guys at 4. can't wait! this dinner is gonna be so great! in your face, last year ""me""! hey rach. yeah. what's emma doing today? well, let's see... uh... i know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. why? well, i wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant. oh my god! that's the creepiest thing i've ever heard! okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she's a real dog! oh! phoebe, all babies are beautiful! oh... okay. phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, i mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy... and a thousand dollars. ...is something i'm very interested in! oh please, do not tell ross. he still believes that what's in the inside is important... okay, oh, and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition. where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving? well, i was thinking... oh, take the clothes of joey's cabbage patch kid. yeah! did someone drop the baton again? why come all the way from kansas to do that? i don't get older. i just get better! you know what just occurred to me? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean, we could be getting a baby soon! you don't know that. somebody is gonna pick us. yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks! i'm telling ya! it's gonna happen. next year it's gonna be you, me and the little hemingway bing. what, he's my favourite author! name one of his books. ""the firm""? ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready... you know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. let me help this year. oh, chandler, that's sweet. but you don't have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do. i'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile"". ok, let's see... oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it. tell me more. okay, i'm gonna go check on something across the hall. you start by washing these not with soap!! you obviously haven't tasted my palmolive potatoes! hey! hey, guess what joey has! three tickets to today's rangers game!! dude, i wanted him to guess. oh. oh my god! yeah, they're great seats too! guess where they are? center ice. did i do something to you? hmm, the game's at one. so? dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back. so we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time. you say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up. dude, two times that happened! look, monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go! he's right, man. right, i guess. alright, so see you at four. okay. and get ready to taste my very special cranberries. or should i say... chanberries! that's some gentle comedy, dude. we're still going at the game, right? yeah! yeah. this is contestant number sixteen, rebecca... hey. oh phoebe, listen. well, i think we gotta go. this place is really freaking me out. i've been watching this guy over there, i don't think he came with a kid! we can't leave now! there was this one baby, haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! this competition just blew wide open, folks! phoebe, i think... it's just too weird, i just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on! oh, i know, we should have been more prepared. it's okay. now, the way i see it, our real competition now is cameron. oh my god, they just took her sweater off. look at those arms! hello michelin man. oh, phoebe! come on! you know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to emma's group yet. we gotta go, we got dinner! but emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way! phoebe, you have to calm down. okay. rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area are in this room right now! i overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to emma! really? yeah! you heard them say that? yeah! all right, okay. alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about! good! oh yay! let's get down to business! emma needs some makeup! no, what? well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants! no phoebe, i am not letting you put makeup on my baby! why not! because i already did! oh, bob, get off the guy! oh! what a game, huh? i know, yeah. i can't believe chandler is missing this! yeah. i am sorry he's not here too, but i got to say, i am really enjoying nacho chair. yeah, i'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away. ohhhh! these seats are great! i know, i know! when i was here for holidays on ice i was sitting so far away michelle kwan couldn't read my banner! wow, hey, we'd better get going. if we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner. oh, but it's a kind game! so we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal. i don't know... one more fight! okay. okay. where is everybody? they're forty-five minutes late! i can't believe they are not here! i slave and i slave for what? they've ruined cranberry day! how late are we? forty-five minutes. wow here! okay. rachel and phoebe are already there, okay?

no... no, we're late! what are you doing here! we're late too! we figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time don't point that thing at me, tribbiani! so, nobody's here? monica's gonna kill us! yeah, where were you! yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy! uh, we were at the spelling bee! and i won! you won an adult thanksgiving day spelling bee. yes! y-e-s. yes! let me see this... grand supreme little darling, new york division. yeah. that's me! you entered emma into a beauty pageant? and it looks like she put makeup on her! wait a second, wait a second, where have i seen that cowgirl outfit before... i can't believe this, she's our daughter! that you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable! she won a thousand dollars! so this is an annual thing? oh! that's alicia mae emory's outfit! you guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier! yeah. what are we gonna do? well, i don't know, you guys figure it out, i got to put emma down for a nap. all right. hey rach, while you're in there, throw something on alicia mae. alright, what are we gonna say?

i got mugged. and they stole my pocket. we're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. hey! ooh! how about this: we can say that monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. that way we're right on time! or... or, we can plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops on her. that would be a good way to get rid of all the pcp we have lying around. you know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. we'll just act casual. we're not late, we're right on time. we know you're out there. who do you think its from? oh, god. this is bad. this is so bad. well, let's just go in there and face them. well, i'm not going in first. i bet that vein on monica's forehead is popping like crazy. i hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning. oh, hey, i have an idea. why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. ready? . ah-haah! i win!! what is that? that's fire. beats everything. oh, really? does it beat water balloon? . ooh! well played, phoebe buffay, well played. alright, enough, enough, come on. let's just all go in at the same time. alright, okay. it's locked. wha...?

water balloon! what are we gonna do? i'm starving. oh, i just remembered. we do have something to eat. monica put something in our oven this morning. oh yeah! hey, you touch that and you will be sorry. guys, i'd listen to her. the vein is bigger than i've ever seen it. huh... oh my god it's brussels sprouts. that's worse than no food. ha-ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts! stinky?! please let me stay on this side of the door. oh, i know... i still have my old key! we can just unlock the door. well, i don't know if that's such a good idea. they clearly don't want to be with us. you know what? i don't want to be with them either, but it's thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? look them in the eye. i know i can get them to forgive us. i don't know... i'm telling ya... i can do it. yeah, he can do it! oh! oh! it all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing... the cranberries...?

i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word. but just think, ok? what if everything goes right? what if this woman does pick you guys? oh my god. she's gonna pick us! so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'? you know, i know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? if this works out, we're gonna have a baby chandler, a baby! yes, but... oh my god, it's gonna work! we're gonna make it work! i'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! all right, i'll see you suckers. i'm gonna get me... a baby! oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!! hey, who's phoebe with?

i mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. but on top of it, you're married to a reverend? i don't think that's exactly... let her finish, doctor. hey. oh, my friend sarah had a great time last night. well... yeah! so you're gonna call this one back? nope. what are you talking about? sarah's great! oh, really? you know what your great friend did? we're out to dinner, ok? we're getting along, having a really nice time. i was thinking she was really cool. and then, out of nowhere... that's it?

you know about the plate thing? oh, yeah. joey doesn't share food. i mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ... you wouldn't let her have a grape? oh no! not me! emma! joey doesn't share food! well, i still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. you are calling her! and if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table! i like that! a sharing buffer! yeah! i'll order some extra fries! maybe a plate of onion rings. yeah. and a shrimp cocktail. and some buffalo wings. maybe an individual pizza, uh? and some mozzarella sticks. what were we talking about? you know, we should just go, i'm not gonna find anything here! this stuff is ridiculous! ah, this place is great! wow! rach, come on, i'm not gonna wear any of this! nothing silver. . ok? nothing with hair! and nothing with padlocks on it! . ross, look, i know that some of this stuff is out there, but i mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . i mean, this is just beautiful! wow, this is really soft . three hundred and fifty dollars? yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. hey, check this out! it's totally you! wow! yeah! actually this looks like pretty good! yeah! boys will be boys? what? they will be! all right, that's it, i'm getting out of here. no, no, no, no! ross, wait! come on! you know, there's other stuff. here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants... uh, actually these might look pretty good on me. yes, they will! you know what you should do? just go take a walk, all right? i know your size and i'm... i'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you. really? yes! and i know what looks sexy on guys. please, just wear what i suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you. so, you're saying, uh, if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers? why do men keep talking to me like this? the adoption agency in ohio. monica and chandler are still talking with erica. so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you? yeah, i read some great applications, but then i thought ""who better then a minister to raise a child!"" amen. plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor! uh, good hands. healing hands. reverend, can i ask? does the bible say anything about adoption? it says ""do it!"". and behold she did adopt onto them a baby. and it was good. wow. yeah, wow. i was wondering you both have such serious jobs. would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? oh, you know, my flock is good, i mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. good flock. flock, flock, flock. being a doctor must take up a lot of time. no-ot for me it doesn't. so, how's everything going in here? we're great, i think i may have asked all my questions. do you have any question for erica? yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? yes, our system assures total anonimity. we're very proud of it. you should be. you're really on top of stuff.. well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk. actually, i don't think we have to. we don't? yeah, when i read about you two, i was pretty sure i wanted you, but i just thought we should meet face to face. . i've made my decision. i choose them. oh my god, this is great! this is so great! . did you hear that? yeah, i did. hey, thank you. thank you so much. . you are so going to heaven! joey's apartment. rachel and phoebe walk in, loaded with bags.] we got some really great stuff! yeah, yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got. oh! really? do you wanna try some of them on for me? oh! okay. wait, are we in joey's imagination? oh no! i took one of ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing. oh, well, ross probably has it, you can get it from him later. ross walks into central perk, wearing a pink and white ladies shirt. joey is on the couch] so? what do you think? i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!! yeah! yeah! rachel picked it out for me. she told me to trust her and you know what? i'm glad i did! i turned quite a few heads on my way over here. dude, i really don't think you should be wearing that. oh, i see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies? looks like someone is the ladies!! you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. yeah, now if you'll excuse me i have a date. see? all eyes on me! we are not signing those papers. why not? it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else. god works in mysterious ways. you have gotta stop! but she liked us. she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica. well, if you think about it, i am kind of like a reverend. i mean, as a chef, i serve god, by feeing the hungry and poor. your veal chop is $34,95! c'mon chandler, i think we have been given an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been made. they are writing up the paper right now. but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this? because... we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us. i know.. i mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? what if, what if no one ever picks us? oh, honey.. please.. please, we are so close. monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's going to. monica: okay, right. so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us. maybe she will. uh! why couldn't i have been a reverend? you're jewish. technicality! a garden salad for the lady oh, that looks great! good ordering! seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. enjoy! mmmh, those fries look delicious. oh, i didn't know you liked french fries. help yourself! what's mine is yours. oh wow, are those stuffed clams? uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams. how about those fries though, huh? they are delicious you are beautiful, you know that? oh, that is so sweet.. oh okay.. now look what you did!! what? what is the matter with you? i don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay? but you just said ""what's mine is yours""? well, i didn't mean it! fine, i'm sorry, i didn't think it was that big a deal. i'm sorry, i'm overreacting. okay, it's just when it comes to food, i have certain rules, okay, i mean there are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do . wow, this place looks great. oh! you are gonna love it! and i'm so glad, we're finally doing this. me too! here so this was fun! i really am sorry about, you know..before. i just want to make sure you know that i really do like you. sure just not as much as clams. well, stuffed clams. chocolate torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman. uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake. yes, that's raspberry coule. so stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy. oh my god! oh, all right, i'll just have what she's having instead. oh, i'm sorry sir, that was our last piece. mmmm! mmm! oh, no! this is work. i should call in. can you excuse me? oh yeah, sure. no problem. what are you doing? i thought you don't share food. sure i do. coule? no. if i can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. this is a two way street. really? really! now this all better be here when i come back. yeah, of course. i can control myself. stop staring at me! why, just a tiny little... oh-oh! time lapse i'm not even sorry. hi! hey. hey. so, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. there's a lot to go over, but i'll explain everything as we go through it. i-is... is that a picture? yeah. it's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. i thought you might want to see it. look, doctor! i don't understand. the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor. what? that's impossible. i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. i'll go check your file. excuse me. so who are you? well, our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york. yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. so you lied to me before? well, we... ""bore false witness""... see i could be a reverend. i can't believe this. but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider... giving you my baby? you think i'd give you my child after this? well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file... i don't want to look at your file! this is over. erica wait! i've nothing to say to you. you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again. why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising. oh yeah. i actually liked you guys. but it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please? you still want that baby? god bless you chandler bing! turns out this sweater is made for a woman. so, why are you still wearing it? because it's soft... hey, so how was your date? ooh... not so good. well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy? yeah, and you know what? we could do a lot worse. joey doesn't share food!"

what were the things you said? don't you love the huge yard? and the fireplace in the bedroom. and nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents! this is bringing out a lovely color in you! so? do you think we should get it? i don't know. what do you think? i think we should. i do too. this is huge! i know. how bad you wanna smoke, right now. i don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy's car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day. gotcha. when do we tell them about this? we don't. not until it's a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing. okay. right. oh my god that is gonna be so hard. i know. gooooood luck with it. i just can't see chandler cheating! i'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy! chandler? forty-five minutes? well, something is not right. i just can't believe he would do this to monica! i know, and with the baby coming? so, should we tell her? i don't know. phoebe, if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you? why? who'd you seen him with? no one, i'm just saying if... tell me what you know! i know nothing! mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical! all right. . he is a good guy. you're right, he wouldn't cheat. believe me, if i did see with someone, there's no way i... who did you see him with? oh, look at her, so happy! if only there were a smaller one to clean this one! hey, is uhm... is chandler here? no, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up? well, look, whatever happens, we're here for you and we love you. all right... we think chandler might be having an affair. what? phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester. they went in together. so sorry. oh my god! oh my god that's awful! what did you think of the house? what? monica, you understand what we are saying, right? yeah, sure... uhm, i'm devastated, obviously... did you think the neighborhood was homey? hey! you son of a bitch! is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here? phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair. who's nancy? what's going on? ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big. yeah i'm not having an affair. nancy is our realtor. i knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!! why do you have a realtor? uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city. what? are you serious? when we found out that we're gonna get this baby, chandler and i started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city. so you're gonna move? oh my god. shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?! what is wrong with raising a kid in the city? i'm doing it, ross is doing it, sarah jessica parker is doing it! and that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset... ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by. so you wanna buy a house in the 50's? have you thought about what you would be giving up? you can't move out of the city, what if you want chinese food at 5am? or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door? you know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay. no, no, it's not, don't listen to him! i'm gonna thump you! it's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be. actually, we already found a house we love. what? and about an hour ago, we made an offer. bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh? time lapse you put an offer on a house? it's so sweet. it really is. it has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... wha..? again with the nature, what are you? beavers? i know this is really hard and we're really sorry. is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food? because i can stop doing that, i really, really think i can! you know that's not the reason joe. we think if you saw it, you'd understand. i mean you guys were there. it is beautiful, isn't it? yeah it is. what the hell are you doin'? well, it is, all right? when we were out there today, all i kept thinking was: i can't believe chandler is screwing this woman, but man this would be a nice place to live! yeah, but so is this. yeah, i mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. i mean, how can you leave this place? c'mon daddy, listen to me! all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe! you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe?

it's joey. i got it! how about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster? oooohh that's interesting. if you win, we give up the birds. dah!! but if we win, we get your apartment. oooooh! deal! time lapse what was monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?

four? five months? i mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! so, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! hey ross. what's up bro? what the hell are doing?!! hey, what's-what's going on?! well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica. dude! he's right there! i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! my best friend and my sister! i-i cannot believe this! look, we're not just messing around! i love her. okay, i'm in love with her. i'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. i'm sorry, but iit-t's true, i love him too. my best friend and my sister! i cannot believe this. well, this is the last box of your clothes. i'm just gonna label it, ""what were you thinking?"" funny, because i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler. ok, you guys, i don't mean to make things worse, but umm, i don't want to live with rachel anymore. what?! you're just so mean to each other! and i don't want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you! well, phoebe that's fine because i'm not moving. whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you gotta take her! y'know, i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. she gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that i'd like. what else? when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. yeah, i do. i-i do, do that. that's nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom. when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. well y'know, i don't want you to be cold. and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive. you were so great. you made it so easy. and now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!! time lapse hey. she really left. i know. thank you. no problem roomie. can i ask you a question? sure! what the hell is that dog doing here?! little toast here. i know this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked. that's so sweet. and hey, here's to a lousy christmas. and a crappy new year. here, here! you can't move. you just... you just can't. rachel's right. this is where you guys belong. yeah, you don't wanna live in westchester. that's like the worst of the chesters. you know, sometimes when i'm alone in my apartment, i look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching tv or something, but... it makes me feel better. and now when i look over, who am i gonna see?

you had a bathroom break at 2030. pee on your own time, mike! . now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. okay. you just get in, do your thing and get out! is that what you say to chandler? it's 2101 and i am not amused. . ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. ok. hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. so tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but mike and i didn't get off to the best start. . my friend joey and i decided to fix each other up with friends so i, i... oh i... hum... i gave it a lot of thought and i fixed him up with my friend mary ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... it's not important... she is in rehab. anyway, so, ok, joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend mike, only he didn't have a friend mike so he just brought, uhm, my mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. ok, i wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here... oh god. and... moment's over! so, ok, uh, i can forget that. i can forget that and uhm... oh this is funny! oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... oh, ok, well, uhm, i . ok, ok, i, ok, i.... monica i can't do it like this! this is my wedding! okay, i don't want this or this or this ok?

ok. if that's really what you want, then here... i give you the headset. well, i don't really want to give you the headset. well i guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. wow, this is a lot! uh-huh, but i'm sure you can handle this. i mean, i have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, i'm sure you'll do fine. you won awards? mm-mh. i printed them out on my computer. hey! hi. where's rach? she's in her room, why? i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? i'm not gonna watch chandler up there while i'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . oh! my god! you're breathtaking! what d'you want? you haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you? oh, ross, c'mon, please! don't make this harder than it already is! i'm not! i'm making it easier! pick me! well, chandler said that it's really important to him too! listen, listen. whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! now, i promise i won't say a word, but if you pick chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time! oh, you are the lesser of two evils! yes, yes! sven i don't understand what you're saying! what is wrong with the flowers? lorkins? what the hell are lorkins? i know. hey. listen, mike, if you were swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be? orchids? right there! that's why i'm marrying you! hello michael. joseph. may i have a word with you, please? this is... great... have a seat. last night, i tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... i cannot allow this. are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie? more back talk. and yes, i may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""family honor 2: thissa time itsa personal."" joey, i kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want? i want you to take this seriously! phoebe is very very important to me, ok? and i wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her. joe, i love phoebe. she's the single most important thing in my life. i'd die before i let anything happen to her. that's what i wanted to hear! because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family. that must have been one lousy movie. that was me! hi hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy! even so, i think i'm gonna pick ross. let me tell you why you need to pick me. see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. anyway, if i'm the only one left out of this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. all right fine, i pick you. y-y-yeeesss! make ""groom"" for chandler. oh my... no! we're gonna do it my way. because your way is stupid! alright i gotta go, i have another call, reverend. hello? i'm glad we had this little talk. yes. yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. that didn't make me uncomfortable at all! alright, so i'll see everybody tonight? okay. bye. uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall? oh my god, what's it doing here? ugh, i guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. uh! what a pickle. oh my god, everything is such a mess. why is this happening to me? how bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? how's it going? good. i'm just getting some coffee. so i'm alert for the wedding. that's what i was doing too. well, you have fun tonight. you too. oh, i will. me too. wait a minute, i know why i'm being such an ass, why are you? i'm not supposed to tell you. i'm not supposed to tell you! you told us both we could be in the wedding? well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other. rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. you and me together again. rach, rach, knock knock. who's there? i'll tell you at the wedding. uh. hey, i forgot my scarf. you know what, i can't do this. i don't know which one of you guys to pick. oh, you haven't picked yet. oh good, 'cause i had an idea. i thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. chappy. what? a dog? no! rachel gets to choose. wow, this is a tough one. i think i'm gonna have to go with the dog. alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? are you, are you freaking kidding me!? how's it going? help me. what? i want you to be crazy bitch again. really? please? you really want me to come back? more than i wanna get married. ok people, we are back in business! oh god, we've missed you soo much! ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and i'll take care of everything. hey, what are you guys gonna do?

uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl. i can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today. i know. wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. you always wanted to get married outside. why don't you guys just do it on the street? what? well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. i mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. this could be the simple wedding you've always wanted! what do you think? i think i wanna get married to you today. me too! monica, do you think we could do it? affirmative! ok let's get these chairs out here! gunther, hit the christmas lights. okay, who left the ice sculpture on the steam grate? michael! hey! you made it. great! chappy! hi! hi! mom, i know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of... no... it's lovely. the lights and the snow. i could look at them forever. i crushed a pill and put it in her drink... come on, sweetheart. you know, chappy's too small to handle all this snow. someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle. so technically, would this person be in the wedding? i guess. i'll do it! no, but chandler, hello... aren't you scared of dogs? i'm not scared. i'll just take little chappy and... he can sense my fear. my throat is exposed. well, i guess i'm in the wedding then. ha haaa... he stinks! level 1 alert. i repeat, level 1. this is not a drill. okay we've got a situation. the minister just called. he's snowed in. he can't make it. oh, no! oh hey, don't worry. i'm still ordained from your wedding. really? yeah, you'd think i'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? huhuh... uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free. i had to read the bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do. okay, if joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle. i'll do it. i'll... na ha ha... ne he he... ah ah... okay, mike and joey, get in position. chandler, come with me. okay, joey's doing the ceremony and chandler's giving you away. oh, okay. hi new dad. so, you're ready to do this?

oh, sure. yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. that's great. yeah... it's almost definitely him. how's that now? well, there is a chance it's another guy. i mean, i have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too? no, he's in prison. was he falsely accused of something? no... he killed his father with a shovel. but other than that, he's a great guy. i'll bet his dad doesn't think so. are you awake? of course i'm awake. assume from now on that i'm always awake! alright, we don't know that it's him. i mean, it could be the football guy. honey, it's us. of course it's the shovel-killer. alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? no! would we treat him any differently? i'd keep an eye on him! we have to find out which one the father is. how? i dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right? yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm! we will now count from one to five. un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq. huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk! good job. thank you. hey joey. hey! listen, i feel really badly about yesterday and i thought about it a lot and, and i know, i was too impatient. so lets try it again. oh, no, that's okay, i don't need your help. i worked on it myself and i gotta say, i am pretty good! really, can i hear some of it. sure, sure. ok, ""bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu"" see? well, you're not, you're not... you're not... again, you're not speaking french! oh well i think i am, yeah and i think i'm definitely gonna get the part. how could you possibly think that? for one thing, the guy on the tape said i was doing a good job! hey rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee? sure. you've been quiet all morning. is everything okay? hmm-hmm. you sure you're alright? yep. o-kay. well, i'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. fyi.. there it is... in the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night? i was just trying to do the right thing. really? well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied! well... oh stop that! i can't believe this. i was just being a good guy. i treated you with respect and understanding. oh, that is so hot. hey, i was looking out for you. oh, really, well ross, you know what? i am a big girl. i don't need someone telling me what is best for me. i gotta say, i have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever. oh, really, really? well, it wasn't very good for me either. hey you know what? you know what? to avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again. what? that's right, sex is off the table. i am never having sex with you again. dr. green, are you feeling better? hey! how was lunch? we had a good time. by the way, i wanted to ask you something. it would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, jiminy billy bob oh, really? no! you we're right, that was fun! i'm gonna go finish packing. o-okay. so, is she gonna take the test? nope, she doesn't have to, i found out who the father is. oh god. it's shovely-joe, isn't it? no it's not. how do you know? well, it turns out that erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way. oh god! what was it? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do? the thing we never do. shovely joe! whenever you're ready joey. right. dja bu bu claude. uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo. i'm sorry, what's going on? dude, come on! french it u-up! joey, do you speak french? toutes la smore! bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! pfoof! you know what. i think this audition is over. uh, excuse me. uh, i am reginé philange. i was passing by when i heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my french town of estée lauder. you really think this man is speaking french? sa-sa-saw! écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. c'est mon petit frère. il est un peu retardé. alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... good job, little buddy. that was some really good french. but i think we're gonna go with someone else for the part. ah. all right. but my french was good? it was great. oh-hoh! ha-hah! see! merci. au revoir. yeah-hah. toute-de-le-fruit. emma's down for the night. oh, good. so uh... i guess i wanna take off. okay... hey listen, just before you go i-i again, i just wanna say ""thank you"" for coming with me. oh, no problem. and also, you know i uh, i was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again. thank you. i'm glad you agree. it's a shame though, i mean, when we did it, it was pretty good. yeah... yeah, that's true. hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...? oh, ye-ah! you know it was you're uhm... birthday... ...valentine's day... oh yeah! well, i guess that's all in the past, now. hmmm-mmmm. not even one more time? not even once. no matter how much we want it. even if we want it really bad. that's what we decided. uhm, right! ...it's kinda hard though! yeah. you know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste. ...i hate waste. ...ross? yes? just so you know... with us... it's never off the table. damn it. it's never off the table. okay, can you really tapdance? no. it's off the resumé. archery? no. horseback riding? would fall off a lot. you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?

how did this happen? well, my boss was at the same restaurant where i was having my interview and he heard everything. so later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because i'm not a team player. and i said ""wait a minute! yes i am."" and i had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true. oh god. i'm so sorry. hey! wha-hoo! what's this?

10.0,15.0,Estelle Dies,"previously on friends... how did the job stuff go? he offered me one. you know what? this calls for a bottle of israels finest. the job is in paris. oh, god! please, somebody say something. so if you take this job you'll be moving to paris? or facing a bitch of a commute. i know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. and i've already talked to them about our situation with emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable. okay. i mean, i'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... anything we want. my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. all right, we'll work it out. thank you! thank you! yeah, yeah! you sure this is what you want? i think it is. ooh, what's going on? i got a really incredible job offer. hey, great! all right! good for you! it's in paris. what? no, no, no! no, no... no... no, no... no, too much is changing, okay? first, phoebe getting married congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs... hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive... well, it comes and goes. i wouldn't trust it. look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. and it means a lot if you could try to get on board. of course we can. congratulations. yay! joey... no, no, no. my hugs are reserved for people staying in america. joey, it would mean so... hey! no! get your france-going-arms away from me. joey... you okay with this? well, it makes me feel sad, but... talking to ross. i see. well, rachel moving to another country? not being able to see her every day. how can i be okay with this? i know, but what are we gonna do? she really needs this job. do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it? how is that gonna happen? is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes? i don't know. i could talk to her boss. yeah! i met him at that christmas party. we really hit it off. you mean the guy who kept calling you ron? i didn't say we were brothers. hey phoebe. hey, tell me what you think. all right. the house next door to the one that we're buying in westchester? just went on the market. i wanna take a look at it, but chandler doesn't. we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. we're not very bright. but what if it is better than ours? should we at least look? what do you think pheebs? well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins... anyway... hey, isn't joey's agent estelle leonard? yeah. she died. you're kidding! that's terrible! yeah, last saturday. wow! she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic. oh, wait a minute, i read the wrong one. oh yeah? yeah, she was just an agent. joey's gonna be *so* upset. i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic. well, we cannot tell joey about this. he's already flipping out about everything that's changing. this will push him over the edge. seriously, you don't think we should tell him? well, not for a little while. let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else. what if he reads it in the paper? unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we're okay. yeah, i'm a friend of rachel green's. uhm, actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago. oh right, uhm, don? close. ron. uh... what can i do for you? uhm, well... i'm here to see if you'll give rachel her job back. ah, did she ask you to come here and do this? oh, no. at first i have to get you to agree. then we'll see if she wants to come back. wow, that is tempting. look, she loved her job here. and let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. isn't that true? she is good! huh, i took a shot there. but i'm sorry. there's nothing i can do... ah, it's not true, there is... nothing i want to do. i see... thanks very much. is this your son? yeah, his name is ross. what? oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to ron. does he.. does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance? yeah, they're all he talks about, why? how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . i just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. let me start again. i'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones... fossils! you can really arrange that? you let rachel come back, and it's done. well, i guess having rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. yeah! yes! thank you! this is great. thank you so much. and i swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life. that's great. i worry about little ross. he's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs. he'll be fine. hey phoebe. hey. everything ok? i'm just mad at my agent. estelle? why? there's a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didn't even be put up for it! she'd better have a good reason. i'm guessing she does. well i'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this. well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. all right, i gotta go. just listen. promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her. ok. why? because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. i love that saying! hello? joey, it's estelle. i was just gonna call you! that's weird. it's a little coincidental, but believable. . listen, i'm sure you're wondering why i didn't get you an audition for that tv movie. yeah, actually i am! i guess i dropped the ball there. whoopsie! that's it? you know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball. don't take that tone with me. who you think you are? alan lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic? no, no, look. all i'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? and you're not getting me into any auditions and i'm tired of it. what are you saying? i'm saying that... . this isn't working for me anymore, ok? estelle, you're fired. goodbye. . man, tough week for estelle! hi. hi. emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. you know she can't sleep without it. oh, well, she's asleep now. stop forcing that thing on her. ok. oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! ralph lauren called, and gave me my job back! nooo! yee. i mean, it was so weirdest thing. they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! i mean, that place must have been falling apart without me. so, you're not going to paris. no, i'm still going. wh... wh...what? when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! isn't that great? yeeeah! oh, sure. i'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around. thanks. it feels like we're cheating on our house. and if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do? ours is so much better! this living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! what a hole! so? what do you think? love it! well, we already have one offer on it, and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one. they could be our neighbors, what are they like? oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. she and her husband have two kids, he's on wall street and she... oh my god! sure. hey joey, want come with me to... are you ok? yeah, i just... i just feel bad about firing estelle. this is got to be killing her. no, that wouldn't kill her. ordinary embolism might. i don't know. she's got to be taking it hard, i was like her only client. except for this guy who eats paper. and i'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. look, i know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. i'm gonna call her and hire her again. no, no, no! don't call her! you wait for her to call you why? because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart. you blow me away. all right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you? i promise. and that means, never having to give a reason. and yet i never run into beyonce! you two know each other? oh, we go way back. before monica made an honest man out of him, chandler used to be my little love muffin! . so? are you guys thinking of getting this house too? ooh! are we gonna have a bidding war? i'd better warn you, i'm a toughie don't, don't! no, actually, we're buying the house next door. why!? i don't know why. ooh, that decides it then. i was on the fence. but knowing that you two would be our neighbors? ah! now we have to get it! ellen, we're going to talk numbers. this can not be happening! okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. maybe the janice's won't get it! maybe the other couple will. the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the hitlers. okay, okay, all right. what if we got both houses? huh? we can turn this house into a guest house. that is a great idea! and by the way, i don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!? okay, you come up with an idea. alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. we can still get out. but we love our house. will we love it so much with her next door? and she's gonna be louder out here too. just the crickets and ""oh my god""! okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! i mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. i mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. well, we have to do something. we can't have her living next door. oh, that does it too. who is it? it's me. ron. look, i um, i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back. this may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job. just hear me out. how would you feel about offering her a raise? not good, ron. perhaps i can persuade you. what if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica. wow, that's pretty cool huh? so? we have a deal? okay, you got it. yes! yes! this is gonna make me very popular. oh, believe me, the ladies, they love it! i meant with my son. good, 'cause the ladies, not so much. oh my god. hello? joey, it's estelle. estelle? yeah, i wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me. ok-ay. i just, i can't believe you're calling me? well, i didn't think i should just drop by... no, no, no! don't drop by, don't drop by! anyway, you did what you had to do. i'm okay. can i ask you something? uhm, what's it like there? it's alright. look kiddo, i gotta go. good luck with the career. you're gonna be huge. thanks for everything estelle. bye. ""out of area"". boy, i'll say. the hitlers will be so disappointed. all right, i got to run. tell monica i say goodbye. and... i'll see you later, neighbor. wait! i just want you to know that... i'm so happy you're going to be here. oh, me too... because... that way... we can pick up where we left off. huh? i never stopped loving you. oh... my... yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein. chandler, what are you talking about? now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and monica never have to know a thing. i don't know what to say... i mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us. obviously. but i love my husband. and i know you love your wife. now, i don't think we should get this house now. don't say that. don't tangle the dream and take it away. chandler, one of us has got to be strong. i understand. although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... goodbye chandler bing. they're never coming down now. hi! hey! you are never going to believe what happened to me today. what? ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money. they did? yeah. it was the weirdest thing. zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. and that i should thank some ron... i don't even know what department that guy's in. so, what are you gonna do? well, i took it. that's great! so you're staying in new york! yay! whoo! yay! you're excited, right? ye-ah. yeah! you know, the money's great. it's certainly the easier choice... right! yeah, you know, was i looking forward to going to paris? sure. you know, was i excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? ooh, absolutely... oh...! yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. i'm fine going back to a job where i've pretty much gotten everything out of that i possibly can... uhm, i hadn't no you... i had no idea you were so excited about paris. uhm, i mean, you said you were scared. well yeah, but i mean, it was good scared though, you know? like when i-moved-to-new-york scared. or uhm, when i-found-out-i-was-gonna-have-emma scared... but this is... fine. this is gonna be good. you should go. what? it's what you want. you should go. you really think so? i really do. but i already told zelner that i would come back... i'm sure he'll understand. all right. all right! i'm gonna do it. i'm gonna go to paris. yeah... yeah! i'm going to paris. thank you, ross! yeah, yeah, oh! oh! oh, i'm so happy. then i'm happy too. thank you all for coming. we're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. as estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. dude, where's my speech? that is entertaining. al zebooker everybody. the end"

huh, if i had to guess i'd say rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing the punching. oh, pheebs, i don't even know where to start. ok well, before you do, i know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but i do have something for you. oh, oh. . what is this? it's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the dna to create your own pheebs! i'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture! chandler? i was just in our bedroom and i found these on my pillow. oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play! what are you talking about? these aren't mine. oh yeah, right! good luck getting another scarf dance from me! that would be a terrible punishment. but, i'm serious, i've never seen these before. really? then what are they doing in our guestroom?

oh my god... yeah, i know, it's gonna be even worse for you... god... ross, get ready to do some serious crying. oh, man, i'm not going to be able to handle this. now i know how my students feel at the end of each year. and why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations. mon... okay... i've gotta... just say what it is i'm gonna say... none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. no-one has been more like a sister to me... i know what you mean. you're like a sister to me too. i wouldn't know what i'm gonna do without you... you're the best friend i ever had.  what? i... i... i... that is so sweet. oh no, she took down monica... and i'm the crier in the family. oh god! i could be next. maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. oh, so that thing you said about the thing. it really made me think about that other thing. uh, rach? well it's okay. chandler is talking to her. i really made you think about that thing uh? uh, rach... i think i have something that belongs to you. oh, i'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don't get. no, no, no... they're really yours. we... found them in your old room. well, these aren't mine. maybe monica used to use them with... don't say richard! well, if they're not monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they? well, i think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room. pheebs! yeah! i think these are yours. these are not mine... look how flimsy they are, come on! good god! you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice. can i talk to you alone for a minute? sure. you don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you? where do you think mike really is? oh honey... let me just say something... because once we get into this, i'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, i'm gonna miss you. and i'm so sad that you're leaving. oh, you know what? let's not say anything else. i love you. ooh, not so tight... i'm sorry, just give me one more chance. okay. oh... oh! i'm sor... just go. just go. i can't, i can't. so, i guess you're next. you're ready? i don't think so. oh, you're definately not. i haven't cried like that in years. you cried yesterday at the six o'clock news. that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. god! i can't believe she saved me for last. why are they taking so long? i don't know. but, god, joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well. no, no, no, no! okay, here we go... oh... well... yeah... i think i'm gonna take off. huh? oh, you guys. this was an amazing night. thank you so much. i love you. good night. what? i don't get a goodbye? lucky bastard! unbelievable. she says goodbye to everyone but me. well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit. well, it needs to be plicit. all right, let's think about this. i mean, there's got to be an explanation. uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
