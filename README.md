# Friends Detection App

Hey there! Welcome to the Friends Detection App ðŸŽ‰. This nifty tool allows you to detect your favorite characters from the iconic '90s sitcom Friends using some cool machine learning magic.

## How to Use

1. **Drag and Drop or Click to Select an Image:** It's as easy as pie! Simply drag an image into the highlighted area or give it a click to pick an image from your device. We're all about simplicity here!

2. **Click Submit and Grab a Coffee:** Once you've selected an image, hit that "Submit" button, sit back, and relax. Our AI pals will get to work faster than you can say "How you doin'?".
